            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, we may eaſily anſwer al the obiections of Proteſtants to the contrarie.

But rather we <note place="margin">Iust wonder, that the Churche of Chriſt should not be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> may wonder, that rational Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians wil deny her to be diuinely infallible, or (which is alone) diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely aſſiſted efficaciouſly, whom they cannot deny to be the mother

               <p>Laſtely, it is wel to be noted, that when we ſay, we beleue for Gods authoritie or veracitie, we mean not therby, that we beleue, becaus God doth efficiently cauſe our beleef, namely, by lightining our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or ſtirring vp our wil to beleue, becaus Gods authoritie or veracitie is no efficient cauſe of our beleef, but onely à formal cauſe therof; and alſo, becaus he is in like ſorte efficient cauſe of our hope, or Charitie, as he is of our beleef, and yet he is not cauſe of them by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: but our meaning is, that we beleue not for anie thing which God worketh in vs; but for his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or veracitie, which is in himſelfe.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152999:34"/> is laſtely reſolued into ſuch ſpecial internal inſtinct. For ſuch ſpecial inſtinct can not be anie formal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of our beleef, but onely an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe therof, and faith is not laſtly reſolued into anie efficient cauſe but onely into ſome formal; beſids that inſtinct is peculiar to him in whome it is, wheras the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or reaſon of Catholik faith, is common to al who haue ſuch faith: more ouer it is not euident credible by it ſelf, that ſuch ſpecial inſtinct is from God, and faith is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into ſome cauſe, which is euidently credible, as is the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie both of God, and of his Church in matters of faith; and therfore the reſolution of our beleef into ether of them, is ſufficient and rational. For as when a King ſendeth an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to tel vs ſome thing, we beleue with humane faith, what is told vs, for the authoritie of them both, as for one entire adioint cauſe of our beleef, yet differently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for the Kings authoritie, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152999:34"/> ſecondarily, for the authoritie of his faithful Embaſſador: ſo what we beleue with diuine faith; we beleue for the authoritie both of God, and of his Church, as for one entire and total cauſe of our beleef, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for the authoritie of God, <note place="margin">See infra c. 11 n. 1.</note> and ſecondarily, for the authoritie of his Church, but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the King nether gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, nor increaſeth the fidelitie of his Embaſſador; but God giueth to his Church al the fidelitie she hath for matters of faith.

And the reſolution of diuine faith into the Churches authoritie, is both ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, becaus her authoritie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, is plainly diuine, and is alſo agreable to mens manner of getting faith, who (in ordinarie courſe (are to haue their faith not from God immediatly ſpeaking to them, but from the Church imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſpeaking to them from God; and therfore their faith is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued immediatly into the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church, and mediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the authoritie of God.

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152999:36"/> the Internal Propoſer, neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth points of faith to our mindes, nor engendereth faith in vs, but with the concurſe and propoſal of the external Propoſer. Fiftly they agree, that the External Propoſer, can no way engender diuine faith in vs, without the concurſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. So that they agree in al points touching the Internal Propoſer, and alſo concerning the External Propoſer, that there is ſuch a one inſtituted of God, that his concurſe (ordinariely) is neceſſarie, and that he cannot engender faith, without concurſe of the Internal Propoſer: but they diſagree about the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſarie to ſuch an external <hi>Propoſer,</hi> and who he is, but if we finde out the conditions neceſſarie to ſuch a Propoſer, we shal eaſily finde who he is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt condition neceſſarie to a ſufficient external Propoſer of <note place="margin">Conditions neceſſarie to the external Propoſer.</note> points of faith, is, that he be ſome intellectual perſon, or Companie of Intellectual Perſons. This is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152999:37"/> out of the very word it ſelf. For a <hi>Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſer</hi> ſignifieth a perſon who propoſeth. And alſo, becaus to propoſe points to be beleued, is an act of vnderſtanding, and (as our Sauiour ſaied to the firſt Propoſers inſtituted by himſelf) is to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>preach,</hi> or (as the Apoſtle alſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) to <hi>preach:</hi> and to <hi>teach,</hi> or <note place="margin">Math. vlt. Marc. vlt. Rom. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>preach,</hi> are acts of vnderſtanding. Secondly, becaus (as we shal proue hereafter the external Propoſer is inſtituted by God, for to moue men to beleue points of faith for his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: and al authoritie (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking) is in ſome intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual perſon. Whervpon when the Apoſtle ſaied Rom. 10. <hi>How shal they beleue without à Preacher,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Preacher muſt be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſent, which lawful ſending gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him authoritie or credit, that he is worthie to be beleued in what he propoſeth. Thirdly, becaus vnles we make, the propoſer to be ſome Perſon or perſons, we confound <hi>Propoſer</hi> with <hi>propoſal,</hi> which are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152999:37"/> things clearly diſtinct; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer is ſome perſon, his Propoſal, is his word or writing, ſo that a word or writing, is no Propoſer, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly à <hi>Propoſal.</hi> If anie obiect, that the Church is propoſed in the Apoſtles Creed to be beleued, as wel as other points of faith are, and being a thing propoſed, it cannot be the Propoſer of al points of faith, I denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For the Church being a companie of intellectual perſons, it can propoſe it ſelf to be beleued to be the true Church, as the Prophets and the Apoſtles propoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ſuch, as wel as anie other thing which they preached. But a dead writing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelf, as <note n="a" place="margin">Sup. c. 2. n. 5.</note> Chillingworth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confeſſed, and others <note n="b" place="margin">L. 2. c. 6. ſect. 2.</note> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after wil confeſſ of the ſcripture. And the reaſon hereof is, becaus a writing hath not of it ſelf anie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal authoritie. Beſides, though the <hi>Propoſer</hi> and <hi>propoſed</hi> may ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes be the ſame thing yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer and Propoſal cannot, becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152999:38"/> the Propoſal is that wher with the Propoſer propoſeth what is to be beleued, as the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets or Apoſtles, were their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of matters of faith, and therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not Propoſers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond condition neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a ſufficient external Propoſer of points of faith, inſtituted by God, is that his authoritie be <note n="c" place="margin">See infra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And therfore no humane or natural au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but that which paſſeth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical authoritie, and is ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and diuine, is apt or ſufficient to cauſe ſuch aſſurance of diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

For becaus they think the ſcripture onely hath diuine and infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, they make it alone the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Propoſer of points of faith.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152999:38"/> Beſides, by a ſufficient Propoſer, we mean ſuch á one, as propoſeth matters of faith ſo ſufficiently, as matters of diuine faith require, and whoſe propoſal is ſuch, as it bindeth men to beleue with diuine faith what he propoſeth, and ſuch it could not be; vnleſſ his authoritie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing were infallible, diuine, or diuinely aſſiſted efficaciouſly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third condition, is <hi>ſufficient claritie</hi> in his propoſing points of faith. The reaſon is, becaus if he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not clearly enough propoſe vnto vs the points of faith, we cannot be aſſured, what he propoſeth, or what we are to beleue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fourth condition is, that his Propoſal be neceſſarie in ordinarie courſe, for vs to haue faith. The reaſon is, becaus if his Propoſal were not neceſſarie to vs for to haue faith, he were not the ordinarie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Propoſer inſtituted by God, without whoſe concurſe, God wil not (in ordinarie courſe) produce faith.</p>

And otherwiſe he were not the ordinarie external Propoſer, without whoſe concurſe, God, in ordinarie courſe, wil not engender faith. And we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, who is this ordinarie exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Propoſer of points of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus onely he, is neceſſarie to be known Now of al theſe conditions onely <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> and <hi>claritie in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me points,</hi> agree to ſcripture, as is euident, by it ſelf, and we shal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue more hereafter, and therfore it is not the <hi>ordinarie External Propoſer</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:152999:39"/> neceſſarie to be ſought, and they al agree to the true Church, as we shal proue euidently by Gods holie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.

               <p n="1">1. THERE be two kinds of diuine Infallibilitie: the one <note place="margin">Twoe kindes of diuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallib. litie.</note> increate and intrinſecally diuine, which is in God himſelf, who is the prime veracitie: the other create, and but extrinſecally diuine, in that it is diuinely and efficaciouſly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by God, to teach nothing but truth; and therfore but analogically called diuine, as a holeſome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin is tearmed healthfull. And in this ſorte was the authoritie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, diuine; and is the authoritie or veracitie of the true Church of God, in matters of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152999:41"/> faith. The former diuine authoritie or veracitie, is the principal, alone ſufficient, and abſolutly neceſſarie cauſe of diuine faith: the latter, is but ſecondarie, not alone ſufficient nor ſimply neceſſarie cauſe of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne faith: but onely a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſubordinat cauſe, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie onely in ordinarie courſe; yet both theſe authorities or veracities are ſo Infallible, as it implieth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that ether of them should teach anie vntruth. And as for the former, that need no proaf: and the like is manifeſt of the latter. For it is plain contradiction, that one diuinely ad effectually aſſiſted by God to teach truth, should teach vntruth. And therfore this latter kinde of veracitie may be a ſufficient external and ſubordinate cauſe of diuine and infallible faith, ſuch as implieth contradiction to be fals. For a diuine veracit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152999:41"/> contradiction to be fals, and may be iuſtly giuen as ſuch, for a ſufficient cauſe of our beleef. And this is that kinde of diuine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or veracitie, which we ſay God can giue to men, and which he hath giuen to his Church in matters of faith. Neuertheleſſ we doe not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the Infallibilitie of the Church equal to the Infallibilitie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles; for their Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie was by immediate reuelation from God, and ſufficient to propoſe euen new points of faith, and in what ſmal matter ſoeuer they propoſed as from God, and to be the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church: but the Infallibilitie of the preſent Church, is but by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reuelation from God, nor for to propoſe anie new points of faith, but to conſerue thoſe which she hath receiued from the Prophets and Apoſtles, nor in anie litle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoeuer, but onely in points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie <hi>to the conſummation of Saints and edification of the bodie of Chriſt:</hi> yet in this, both thoſe infallibilities

And the Prophet Iſaie c. 53. v. 1. complaineth thus: <hi>who hath bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued our hearing?</hi> Where (doubtles) he ſpeaketh not of humane, but of diuine beleif, and sheweth, that men should haue beleued him with diuine faith.

And though they afterward ſaied: <hi>now we beleue, not for they ſpeech, for we ourſelues haue heard and know that this is truly the Sauior of the world,</hi> they meant not to denie that her teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:152999:44"/>3. In like manner, the ſcripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that it is damnable ſin and Incredulitie, not to beleue men ſent by God. Marc. vlt. v. 14. <hi>Going into the world, preach the Ghoſpel to euerie</hi>

And how shold it be damnable ſin not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue <hi>them</hi> with diuine faith, if they had not diuine, but only humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie? Nay how could they bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue men with diuine faith, if they had but humane authoritie, which is fallible: And 16. v. 14. <hi>He vpraided their Incredulitie and hardnes of heart, that they beleued not them, who had ſeen him to haue riſen.</hi> Where (doubtles) Chriſt ſpeaketh not of humane, but of diuine beleif, and ſaieth, it was incredulitie, not to beleue <hi>them</hi> with diuine faith. And what Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie or hardneſſ of heart had it been, not to haue beleued <hi>them</hi> with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152999:44"/> diuine and Infallible faith, if they had had only humane and fallible <note place="margin">See infra c. 5. n 2. and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra c. 2. n. 3.</note> authoritie? Nay (as I ſaied before) how could they beleue <hi>them</hi> with diuine and Infallible faith, who had but humane and fallible authoritie or veracitie? And it muſt wel be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he calleth it incredulitie and hardnes of heart, not to haue beleued <hi>them,</hi> that is, perſons, for to auoid a cauil, that he only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Incredulitie of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For he plainly attributeth Incredulitie to not beleif of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who teſtified his Reſurrection. For diuine faith bindeth to beleue both diuine meſſengers, and their meſſage for their authoritie. And therfore it is incredulitie and againſt diuine faith, not to beleue ether. And it could not haue been incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulititie or want of diuine faith, not to beleue <hi>them,</hi> vnles they had had diuine authoritie or veracitie to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his Reſurrection. And if it be incredulitie oppoſit to diuine faith, not to beleue men ſent by God to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152999:45"/> teſtifie, ſurely it is diuine credulitie to beleue ſuch, and if it be diuine credulitie to beleue them, they muſt haue diuine authoritie. For diuine infallible credulitie cannot be but for diuine infallible authoritie. The Apoſtle alſo 2. Theſſal. 3. v. 13. ſaieth. <hi>If anie obey not our word, note him.</hi> And 1. Ioan. 4. v. 6. <hi>who knoweth God, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs who is not of God, heareth not vs: In this we know the ſpirit of truth, and ſpirit of error.</hi> Where (doubtles) he ſpeaketh of infallible knowledg of God, by hearing him; and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible knowledg could not haue been by hearing him, if he had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in teaching Gods truth. And theſe teſtimonies of ſcripture doe not only proue, that God can giue to men diuine and infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or veracitie, but alſo, that he hath giuen it to ſome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the holie Fathers thought, that God can giue diuine or infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authoritie or veracitie to men, wil be euident out of their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note n="a" place="margin">Infra c. 7.</note> hereafter brought to proue,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152999:45"/> that he hath giuen ſuch to the Church. And Reaſon conuinceth, that he can giue ſuch authoritie or veracitie to men, becauſe it implieth not contradiction. For what contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction can be pretended, that God can (if he pleaſe) effectually aſſiſt ſome ſo, that they teach nothing in matters of faith, but truth? as he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly aſſiſteth the elect, that <hi>they cannot be led into error</hi> Math. 24. And his effectual aſſiſtance maketh their authoritie or veracitie to be ſo diuine Infallible, as we deſire, and is ſufficient to be an external mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial, or ſubordinat cauſe of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and infallible faith. For it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth contradiction, that who is efficaciouſly aſſiſted by God to ſay but truth, should lie. And I take it to be ſo euident, that God can giue ſuch authoritie or veracitie to his Church, or to men, as I think ſcarce anie Proteſtant wil haue the face <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If God can giue to men endles eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and yet not make them Gods, why can he not alſo giue them infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible veritie or veracitie, and yet not make them Gods, or Prime veritie? If he can make weakmen not to fall, why can he not make the Church not to err in points of faith? If he can make, that the elect; who are the principal part of the Church shal not be led into error Matth. 24, why can he not make the Church it ſelf? § 45. Naye ſo manifeſt it is, <note place="margin">See infra c. 15. and Cal uin in Luc. 10. v. 16.</note> that God can giue to men this kinde of diuine veracitie or infallibilitie, as Proteſtants themſelues ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes confeſſ, that he hath giuen it to men.

Rom. 10. v. 14. <hi>How shal they beleue, whome they haue not heard. And how shal they heare with out a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? How shal they preach, vnles they be ſent.

Wherfore thus I argue in forme: The neceſſarie cauſe (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie courſe) of infallible faith, is infallible: The Churches preaching is the neceſſarie cauſe (in ordinarie courſe) of infallible faith. Therfore her preaching is infallible. The Maior is euident, becaus a humane and fallible cauſe, cannot produce a diuine and infallible effect. And <note n="g" place="margin">See ſup. n. 2.</note> (as Whitaker l. 1. de ſcrip. p. 166.) <hi>The effect doth not ſurpaſſ the cauſe.</hi>

Beſides, al grant, that the extraordinarie cauſe of infallible faith, by the preaching of the Apoſtles, and Prophets, was infallible, as we shewed in the fourth Chapter n. 5. and why not alſo the ordinarie cauſe by the preaching of the Church? ſeeing the end of both preachings, is the ſame, to wit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible faith. For if ordinarie fallible a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The minor, to wit, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches preaching is (in ordinarie cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe) a neceſſarie cauſe of infallible faith, is plainly the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For he asketh, how shal they beleue without a preacher lawfully ſent, and the Paſtors of the Church are the only preachers lawfully ſent: And out of this neceſſarie dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152999:58"/> of faith on lawful preaching, he inferreth: <hi>Therfore faith is of hearing</hi> to wit, of hearing the preaching of ſome lawfully ſent, which is to make lawful preaching, a cauſe of faith. For if faith be of hearing lawful preaching, lawful preaching is a cauſe of faith. Nether hindereth it, that the word preached, is alſo a cauſe of faith: for the word is the obiect to be beleued, and lawful preaching, is the cauſe of beleuing it. Otherwiſe why should lawful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching be neceſſarie, and notanie kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of preaching, ſuffice.

And alſo, becaus out of the Churches diuine infallibilitie in fundamental points of faith, euidently followeth her like infallibilitie in al points of faith: Nether haue I as yet read anie Proteſtant, who would grant the Church to be diuinely infallible in

The Maior is euident, both becaus to the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Euangeliſts, ſuch infallibilitie was giuen, and therfore the like, to others, whome God putteth in the Church, for the ſame end he put them: as alſo, becaus if they had not diuine Infallibilitie, they were nether fit nor able to conſummate Saints, and keep them vnited and conſtant in diuine infallible faith: For humane veracitie, cannot make men diuinely aſſured. Some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants may ſay, that this proueth, that Paſtors of the Church haue In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie in fundamental points, but not in al points. But, beſide what we haue ſaied before of this diſtinction, and that it is here, both new and groundles, and therfore a mere voluntarie and irrational shift,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152999:63"/> it is clearly refuted. Firſt, becaus Paſtors are ſaied to be put for the ſame end, for which the Apoſtles Prophets, and Euangeliſts were, to wit, to conſummate ſaints, and to keep them vnited and conſtant in al points of diuine faith. And alſo, Paſtors are ſaied, to be put in the Church in the ſame manner for that end, as the Apoſtles were. Secondly, becaus Saints are not conſummate, if they be ſuffered to err in anie points of faith. Thirdly, <note n="m" place="margin">Laude ſec. 16. p 65. 91.

But this Expoſition, or limitation of the Apoſtles words to Paſtors, onely in the time of the Apoſtles, Firſt, is new, (for he citeth no ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it) and therfore is iuſtly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: ſecondly, it hath no ground in the Apoſtles words, and therfore is ameere voluntarie and irrational shift to delude the true ſenſe of them. Thirdly, becaus no Paſtors of the Apoſtles time (diſtinct from Apoſtles and Euangeliſts) wrote anie thing. For S. Mark, and S. Luke were Euangeliſts, and al other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were Apoſtles. And S.

Wheras the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of writings, but of men, to wit, of infallible Paſtors, that were to continue for euer.

For becaus he made the Church, the pillar and ground of diuine truth, he gaue her, to that end, diuine Infallibilitie: Becaus he made the Churches preaching, the ordinarie means of begetting diuine infallible faith, he gaue her (to that end) diuine infallibilitie in matters
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152999:65"/> of faith: becaus he made her Paſtors witneſſes of diuine truth, he gaue them (for that end) diuine infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie in teſtifying that truth. Becaus he put Paſtors for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Saints, and keep them vnited and conſtant in diuine faith, he gaue them (for that end) diuine infallibilitie, in matters of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus both Church and Paſtors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diuine infallibilitie had been vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and vnable to attaine to thoſe ends as is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by it ſelf, and confeſſed by Proteſtants here aboue n. 2 and 5.</p>
               <p>9. The fift argument, shal be taken out of that our Sauior ſaied of the Paſtors of the Church: Luke 10. v. 16. <hi>who heareth you, heareth me, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>

The Maioris euident. For Fallible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible teachers, are not one, but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152999:66"/> quite different kinds of teachers: the Minor alſo is manifeſt. For if they were not one Teacher with Chriſt, it would not follow, that who heareth them, heareth Chriſt. For different teachers may haue dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hearers. And I note, that Chriſt ſaied not, <hi>who heareth your</hi>

For a priuat mans doctrin, may be al one with Chriſts doctrin, but be not one Teacher with Chriſt, becaus he is not a Teacher appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt to ſpeak for him, as Paſtors are. Some Proteſtants anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, <note place="margin">Chilling. c. 3. n. 72.</note> that theſe words of Chriſt, are meant onely of the Apoſtles, who were indeed both infallible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; and one Teacher with Chriſt, but not ſo their Succeſſors. But this limitation of Chriſts meaning to the Apoſtles alone, Firſt, is new, becaus
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152999:66"/> no ancient author is alleadged for it. Secondly, it can haue no other ground in the text, but becaus the words were ſpoken onely to the Apoſtles, which is no reaſonable ground. For ſo al power of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and miniſtring Sacraments, should haue been proper to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s. Thirdly, it is contrarie to the end of Chriſts ſpeech. For as Chriſt made the Apoſtles, Teachers of his doctrin for the good of the Church, ſo he made them alſo one with himſelf for the ſame end. Wherfore as he made Paſtors, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of his Apoſtles, in being Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for the good of the Church, ſo he made them, ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, in being one Teacher with him for the good of the Church: and therfore are ſuch, as long as the Church continueth. Fourthly, the latter part of this ſpeech of Chriſt, is meant of the ſucceſſors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. For who deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth Chriſt, as wel as who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth the Apoſtles. Therfore the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152999:67"/> former part <hi>who heareth you, heareth me,</hi> is alſo meant of the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles. Fiftly, it is contrarie to the Fathers. For S. Cyprian, Epiſt. 69. ſaieth: <hi>Chriſt ſaieth to his Apoſtles, and therby to al Paſtors who ſucceed the Apoſtles by ſucceſsiue ordination, who heareth you, heareth mee.</hi> Laſtly, it is contrarie to diuers Proteſtants, who <note place="margin">p Laude ſec. 16. p. 25.</note> grant, that theſe words are meant both of the Apoſtles, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, but (ſay p ſome of them) <hi>differently,</hi> to wit, <hi>abſolutly, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and conditionally, in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, namely, ſo long, and ſo far as you ſpeak my words and not your own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. But this expoſition is (as the former) new, and without anie ground in the text, and therfore an irrational eluſion of Chriſts words Secondly, it maketh Chriſt to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, vſing the ſame words diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, without anie expreſſion of his different vſage. Thirdly, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of Chriſts ſpeech, to wit, <hi>who deſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſeth you &amp;c.</hi> is meant abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly, aſwel of the Paſtors, as of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152999:67"/> Apoſtles. For abſolutly, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſts Paſtors, deſpiſeth him, as wel, as if they deſpiſed his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, becaus they are his legats, as wel as the Apoſtles were. Fourthly, it is contrarie to the end of Chriſts ſpeech, which was to giue both to the Apoſtles, and to their ſucceſſors aſſurance to teach his doctrin; and to People, to heare and beleue them, becaus they were one Teacher with himſelf. Which end were fruſtrat in the ſucceſſors of his Apoſtles, if his meaning were not abſolute to them, as wel as to the Apoſtles. For what aſſurance should ether the Paſtors haue in teaching, or people, in hearing them, if Chriſts words depend vpon an vncertain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition? Aſſurance requireth an abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: and ſeeing Chriſt meant to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both the Apoſtles, and their teaching, and people, in hearing them, he muſt needs meane abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both of Apoſtles, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Fiftly, it implieth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to be one Teacher with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152999:68"/> Chriſt, and not to be abſolutly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in teaching his doctrin. For how can he who is one Teacher with an infallible Teacher, be not abſolutly infallible? Beſids, it is one thing to teach infallible doctrin, and an other, to be infallible in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching infallible doctrin. And one thing is to heare Chriſts doctrin, and to heare Chriſt. Priuat men, may teach infallible doctrin, yet are not infallible in teaching it: and who heareth them, heareth Chriſts <note place="margin">Vvhitaker l. 3. deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152999:68"/> be abſolutly infallible, whom Chriſt appointeth ſpeakers or teachers for him, and ſpeaketh by them, or. whome hearing, we heare Chriſt Wherfore Thus I argue; Chriſt ſaied abſolutly, and without anie condition, as wel of the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, as of the Apoſtles themſelues; <hi>who heareth you, heareth me,</hi> Therfore abſolutly, and without anie condition, both Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors are infallible. For we cannot be deceaued by Chriſt, by anie way that we heare him. The antecedent is euident by Chriſts words, which are abſolute and haue no condition anie more for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Succeſſors, then for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelues. The conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce alſo is euident: For who abſolutly are ſuch, as hearing them, we heare Chriſt, are abſolutly infallible. And this conſequence thoſe Proteſtants ſaw, who denied theſe words to be at al meant of the Apoſtles Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. For they ſaw, that if Chriſt ſaied abſolutly of them, as wel as of the

                  <note place="margin">Laude p. 65. 91.</note> they muſt need be abſolutly and not meerly conditionally, infallible. Laſtly, Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do not grant, euen conditional diuine infallibilitie, but onely humane, to Paſtors; and yet Chriſt here ſpeaketh of diuine infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie, for ſuch was the infallibilitie of the Apoſtles, and ſuch muſt needs be theirs, whome who heareth, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Chriſt. For who are ſuch, as who heareth them, heareth Chriſt are ſuch as Chriſt ſpeaketh by and ſuch as Chriſt ſpeaketh by, are doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, infallible.

For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is quite different, becaus in the places brought by Chillingworth, ſpeech is of ſome particuler perſons, who nether in themſelues, nor in their ſucceſſors, could continue eternally: and therfore, <hi>for euer,</hi> in them, muſt needs be mant <hi>For their life,</hi> wheras the Apoſtles continue in their ſucceſſors eternally, and therfore <hi>For euer,</hi> ſpoken to them
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152999:74"/> them for the good of the Church, is to be vnderſtood eternally, as properly and vſually it ſignifieth. But it is the common ſophiſtical manner of arguing among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaut writers, to argue from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me few particular improper vſe of words, in ſome matter, againſt the proper and vſual ſenſe of them, euen in a different and diſlike mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is a verie Sophiſtical kinde of arguing, and wel to be noted. For by that, nothing can be aſſuredly proued out of ſcripture. Beſids, Chriſt here ſo promiſeth the aſſiſtance of the Holie Ghoſt for euer, as Math. 28. he promiſeth his own aſſiſtance for euer, but that he promiſeth <note place="margin">Laude ſect. 16. p. 29.</note> eternally. For he ſaieth. <hi>Going, teach al nations, baptizing &amp;c. And I am with you al daies til the end of the world:</hi> to wit, with you, teaching and baptizing. Which sheweth Chriſts aſſiſtance for euer with his Paſtors in their teaching. Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths proofs, that this promiſe was made to the Apoſtles alone, be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152999:75"/> caus in them ſome words pertein to them alone, proue no more, then that the promiſe was in words made to them alone, but not meant to them alone. As Chriſts promiſe to S. Peter Math. 16. that the Church should be built on him, and that he should haue the keyes of heauen, was made to him alone, yet not meant to him alone, but to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors alſo; and commandment was giuen to him alone Ioan. 21. to feed Chriſts sheep, and yet not meant to him alone, but to his ſucceſſors alſo.

And the reaſon of al, is one and the ſame, becaus al theſe promiſes were made to the Apoſtles, for the good of the Church, which was to continue after the Apoſtles. Thus we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the Proteſtants three anſwers to this promiſe of Chriſt, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them to be mere shifts, Nay
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152999:75"/> indeed they turne Chriſts moſt bountiful promiſe made vnto his Church, to nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to what purpoſe is it to teach the Church al fundamental or abſolutly neceſſarie truths, and not tel her, which are thoſe truths? To what purpoſe were it to teach the Church vneffectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Reprobates are taught: To what purpoſe were it, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alone were taught al truth, if the Church alſo were not taught it, who is to teach vs as they taught her.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE Infallibilitie of the Church of God (which ſoeuer she is) in al points of faith, is ſo euident, as it is not onely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſcripture and Fathers, but alſo conuinced by light of Reaſon.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152999:87"/> pure and entire doctrin, is infallible in profeſſion therof. And what ſome may ſay, that they mean onely of puritie of doctrin in fundamental points, is refuted c. 6. citato.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond argument, may be taken from the ends, for which God inſtituted à Church on earth. And to omit thoſe ends, which we brought out of Scripture c. 5. as to be the pillar and ground of truth, to be the ordinarie means of begetting infallible faith, to be Gods witnes of infallible faith, to conſummate and keep the faithful vnited and conſtant in infallible faith; an other end is, that she is inſtituted as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and <note n="b" place="margin">Vvhitaker l. 3. de ſcript. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152999:88"/> by God; The Mother of Chriſtians in infallible faith inſtituted by God, the Miſtreſſ or Guide of infallible faith inſtituted by God, muſt needs be infallible, both becaus of Gods inſtitution, and for the infallibilitie of the end: For a fallible Miſtreſſ or guide, is as good as none; for to learn infallible truth, or to attein to infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſecuritie, or (as Chillingworth ſaieth c. 6. § 20.) <hi>A doubtful Guide is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A fallible Guide naught worth.</note> 
                  <hi>for mens direction, as good as none at al.</hi> And c. 1. n. 7. <hi>I grant, that this means in the Church to decide controuerſies in faith and Religion, must be endued with an vniuerſal infallibilitie, in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it propoundeth for a diuine truth.</hi> And to ſay (as Proteſtants doe) that she is a ſure guide but in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, cannot ſtand with her fallibilitie in other points: For (as S. <note n="d" place="margin">Epist 8. and 9. Difference of Maiſters in faith, and ſcience.</note> Auſtin ſaieth of the Scriptur) if it faile in anie point, it becoms doubtful in al: ſo ſay of the Church, If she can faile in ſome points of faith, she is doubtful in al. And here muſt be wel noted, the diffeence
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152999:88"/> of Maſters or Miſtreſſes in ſciences, and in faith. For Maſters or Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſciences, doe shew their ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers the truth of things in the things themſelues, and ſo they are but shewers of the truths, which they teach, not perſwaders of it; but Maſters or Miſtreſſes of mattets to be beleued, doe not make their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſee the truths (which they teach) in themſelues, but in their own authoritie, and their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the formal cauſe of perſwading them thoſe truths: Wherfore if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants would indeed grant the Church to be Miſtreſſ of Chriſtians in matters of faith, they muſt needs grant, that in her authoritie they ſee the truthes, which they beleue, and for her authoritie are perſuaded of them: but indeed they doe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish between à Miſtreſſ in faith and in ſcience which is a groſſ ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third argument may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that, if the Church be not infallible in matters of faith, there
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152999:89"/> is no external formal cauſe ſufficient to beget diuine faith. For (as I <note n="e" place="margin">See inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed c. 2.) there is no formal cauſe of beleef, but authoritie, nor anie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal authoritie, but in ſome Author, nor anie Author, but ſome intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual perſon, or companie of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual perſons: and faith we cannot haue (in ordinarie courſe) without ſome formal external cauſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to engender infallible faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="4">4. The fourth argument shal be this. The Churches authoritie in preaching or propoſing al Chriſts doctrin is not natural or humane; but ſupernatural and diuine. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is infallible in doing that. The conſequence is euident, becaus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine authoritie is infallible. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent I proue out of thoſe words of Chriſt to his Apoſtles: <hi>Teach al Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, baptizing them &amp;c. teaching</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. vlt.</note> 
                  <hi>them to keepe al that I haue commanded you.</hi> Where Chriſt gaue no humane
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152999:89"/> or natural authoritie to his Apoſtles, but ſupernatural and diuine. And what authoritie of teaching or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing he gaue to them, he means alſo to their ſucceſſors, els theſe should haue no authoritie to preach or baptize; as alſo becaus, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie was giuen to the Apoſtles for the good of the Church, and therfore was to endure as long as the Church endureth: moreouer, the Churches authoritie to preach or propoſe al points of faith, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: Therfore alſo her authoritie to teſtifie and perſuade that it is Gods word, which she preacheth, is diuine. The Antecedent is proued already. The conſequence I proue, becaus perſuaſion, that it is Gods word, which the Church teacheth, is the end of her preaching it. And if God giue her duine authoritie for the means, doubtles he giueth the like for the end, becaus the end is more deſired then the means, and the means deſired but for the end. And if the Churches authoritie in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152999:90"/> teſtifying or perſwading what she preacheth, be diuine, doubtles it is infallible in teſtifying it. For diuine authoritie to perſwade, is infallible. Further more, the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie can force vs to beleue the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be Gods word: Therfore her authoritie is diuine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The conſequence is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus no authoritie can force vs to beleue diuine matters, but what is diuine. The antecedent Proteſtants grant: For thus Whitaker contr. 1. q. 3. c. 7. <hi>I anſwer, as often before, that we are forced by the Churches authoritie to beleue theſe books to be canonical.</hi> And can fallible authoritie force?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fift argument for the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the Church in matters of faith, shal be taken from the great and manifold inconueniences, or abſurdities, which neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the denial of it. As firſt that Chriſt hath giuen vs no competent or fit Iudge of controuerſies of faith For if the Church be fallible, she is no competent or fitt Iudge of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152999:90"/> matters: and the ſcripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Iudge, becaus à proper iudge is an vnderſtanding perſon, and iudgment, an act of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And this is ſo clear, as now <note n="g" place="margin">See infra l. 2. c. 7. ſect. 2.</note> Proteſtants confeſſ, that the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is no proper Iudge: And want of a competent Iudge, would make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſiesendles. And (as Hooker ſaieth in the preface to his book §. 6) <hi>of this we are right ſure, that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Scripture, and Experience it ſelf</hi>

An other great inconueniencie, which denial of the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li ilitie breedeth, is, that it openeth a way to hereſies and ſchiſmes. For vpon pretence of the Churches er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152999:91"/> in ſome matters of faith, a plain gap is opened to depart from her profeſſion of faith, as heretiks doe, or from her communion in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Schiſmatiks doe; And al ſufficient means of ether conſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="7">7.

And this is the true ground of their denial of the Churches diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Infallibilitie in al points of faith, which to haue diſcouered, is to haue refuted.

               <head>NINTH CHAPTER. Some of the Proteſtants arguments againſt the Infallibilitie of the true Church of God, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, anſvvered?</head>
               <p n="1">1. PRoteſtants heap vp great ſtore of Arguments (but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152999:94"/> no expreſſ teſtimonie of Scripture) againſt the Infallibilitie of the Church in matters of faith, that ſo they may by number ſupplie the weakneſſ of them, and if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the Reader, yet confound him; wherfore I wil not relate them al, but the chiefeſt, by anſwer to which, the Reader may ſee, how he may anſwer the reſt. The firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this: The Church may <note place="margin">a Vvhitaker cont. 2. q. 4. 6. 2. 3. Chilling. c. 5. n. 93.</note> err in matters of manners: therfore alſo in matters of faith. I anſwer, that if they mean in the Antecedent, of the vniuerſal Church, I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, of damnably erring, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially erring, and denie, that the whole Church can damnably err in manners, becaus that would make her not holie, and ſo that article of our Creed: <hi>I beleue the holie Catholik Church,</hi> should be fals: and (as Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſaid ſec. 25 §. 5.) <hi>The whole mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church is holie, and ſo we beleue.</hi> Item. <hi>If we wil keep vp our Creed the whole militant Church muſt be holie.</hi> Secondly I denie the conſequence.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152999:95"/> For etror in manners deſtroieth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a qualitie of the Church, which is holineſſ, and without which the ſubſtance of the Church may be; but ſinful error in faith deſtroieth her <note n="b" place="margin">See part. 1. l. 2. c. 6.</note> ſubſtance, and maketh her no true Church of God, but a fals and heretical Church; becaus ſinful er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in faith, is the ſin of hereſie. And alſo euen euerie ſinleſſ error in faith, deſtroieth the end for which the Church is inſtituted, which is to be a ſure and vndoubted <note n="c" place="margin">See ſup. c. 2. n. 2. and c. 8 n. 2.</note> Guide in matters of faith, and to perſwade them, which she could not, if she erred in anie point of faith: For (as S. <note n="d" place="margin">Epist. 8. 9.</note> Auſtin ſaieth of the Scripture) if anie error were found in anie point of her doctrin, her doctrin in other points would be vnſure and ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of error. Beſids, we might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus againſt Proteſtants: the Church may err fundamentally in manners; Therfore alſo fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond argument is that the Church may for ſome time be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152999:95"/> of ſome points of faith; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may alſo err. I diſtinguish the antecedent, of points of faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie <hi>neceſsitate medij,</hi> or <hi>Adeſſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi> and then I denie it. For then she should not be a ſufficient guide of faith; or of points not ſo neceſſarie, and then I diſtinguish alſo of ſinful ignorance, and ſinles ignorance, I denie the Antecedent, for ſinful ignorance is hereſie; or equiualent to it: ignorance not ſinful, I grant the Antecedent; but denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence For error in faith (whether ſinful, or ſinles) includeth vntruth, and ſo is contrarie to the end of the Church, which (as ſaied) is to be a ſure guide in matters of faith, and ſure she cannot be, who propoſeth anie thing as of faith, which ether is not of faith, or is contrarie to faith, for that were vntruth. But ſimple ignorance of ſome point of faith not ſo neceſſarie, is not repugnant to a ſufficient and ſure guide in matters of faith, nor includeth anie vntruth. As it is not againſt the aſſurednes of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152999:96"/> Scripture, that it teacheth not al that is of faith, as it would be, if it taught anie the leaſt error or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: For ſimple ignorance, or not teaching ſomething, includeth no vntruth, but mere vnknowledg, or not teaching that truth, but error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth vntruth, which cannot be in a ſure Guide, as the true Church <note place="margin">Some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is but against the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome not ſo neceſſarie truth, would be againſt the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church: but al error whatſoeuer, ſinful or not ſinful, in anie point whatſoeuer of faith, would deſtroie the end of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third argument may be this: <note place="margin">Vvhitaker cont. 2 q. 4. c. 3. Laude ſec. 16 p. 65. Chilling. c. 3. n. 70.</note> euerie member of the Church may err in faith: Therfore the whole Church: I denie the conſequence both becaus God hath not made euerie member of the Church, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> as he hath made the Church; nor made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of infallible aſſiſtance to euerie member of the Church: and alſo,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152999:96"/> becaus he hath not inſtituted euerie member of the Church for an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and ſure Guide in matters of faith, as he hath inſtituted the Church: And if this note of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Church, which is to be a ſocietie in Chriſts true faith, and not onely in ſome parte of his faith; and the end of the Church, which is to be a ſure and vndoubted Guide in matters of faith, be wel obſerued, we shal eaſily both defend the Churches infallibilitie, and alſo ſolue the Proteſtants obiections againſt it. A fourth argument may be taken out of that which Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth ſaieth c. 3. §. 30. p. 144. <hi>The Churches dependance on the Apoſtles</hi>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:152999:98"/> I anſwer, that by, the Churches Infallibilitie, mean not anie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or abſolute infallibilitie as in God but ſuch as Chriſt ſaieth Matt. c. 24. is in the Elect, who though of their nature may be led into error, yet through Gods efficacious aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, can not. And poſſibilitie of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by nature, and impoſſibilitie of erring by Gods efficacious aſſiſtance, may ſtand together, as they did in the Apoſtles. For this impoſſibilitie or neceſſitie of not erring, is (as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians ſpeak) onely <hi>conſequentiae, non conſequentis.</hi> And neceſſitie of <note place="margin">Neceſsitie of conſequence, not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</note> conſequence, doth not repugne to libertie or freedom. For as of my ſeing one walk, it followeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, that he walk, and yet he walketh freely: ſo of Gods effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance of the Church not to err, it neceſſarily followeth, that she err not, and neuertheles she freely erreth not.

               <p n="4">4. Wherfore now (Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) compare our reaſons for, the Infallibilitie of the Church in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, with the Proteſtants Reaſons to the contrarie, and our ſolutions of their arguments, with their ſolutions of ours, and thou shalt finde a main difference. For one of our Reaſons is taken <hi>a priori</hi> (as Philoſophers ſpeak) from the definitions of the true Church giuen by Scripture, Fathers, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelues: wheras Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants nether bring nor can bring anie Reaſon for the fallibilitie of the

Our third Argument alſo is <hi>a Priori</hi> from the formal external cauſe of diuine faith, which muſt needs be infallible as faith is, wherof it is cauſe; which formal external cauſe of infallible faith affoordeth no colour of fallibilitie. Our fourth argument is taken from Chriſts gift. And our fift <hi>a Poſteriori,</hi> from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as for our ſolutions of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, they are ſatisfactorie and ſcientifical, becaus they are taken from the nature and the end of the true Church, and shew a plain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt thoſe things, which Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts think to be like: Wheras Proteſtants can giue no ſuch ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie or ſcientifical anſwer to our Arguments, taken of the definition, or end of the Churh, but doe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily gloſe the definition and end of the Church as if her eſſence were onely a ſocietie in profeſſion <hi>of ſome parte of Chriſts doctrin,</hi> and <note place="margin">Protestants destroie both the eſſe ce, and the end of the Church.</note> her end to be a ſure Guide, onely <hi>in ſome parte therof,</hi> to wit, in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental or principal parte, which

               <p n="2">2.

For the pillar and ground of truth, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to vphold truth. The true Church is the pillar and ground of Truth, Therfore she is neceſſarie to vphold truth.

Auſtin had ſaied the foreſaied word of himſelf, onely as he was an heretik, yet it would thence follow, that the propoſal and authoritie of the Church is (at leaſt) neceſſarie to begin beleif of the Goſpel, howſoeuer it be not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for to continue it. And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaied, that is is neceſſarie ſo,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152999:119"/> onely as an inducement or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch beleef, becaus (as S. <note n="b" place="margin">L. de vtil. cred. c. 11.</note> Auſtin ſaieth) <hi>That we know, we owe to reaſon, that we beleue, to authoritie.</hi> So that, as Reaſon, is the formal cauſe of our knowledg, ſo is Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the formal cauſe of our beleef: and ſuch cauſe of our beleef of the Goſpel, is the authoritie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church, ſuch, not principal but ſubordinate to Gods authoritie. Chillingworth c. 2. §. 54 p. 54. p. 73. and §. 97. p. 88. ſaieth, That S. Auſtin <hi>by Catholik Church,</hi> meanerh the Church of al ages, including Chriſt and the Apoſtles. But nether proueth he that, nor can tel, how S. Auſtin could be infallibly certain of the teſtimonie of the Church of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles time, but by the teſtimonie of the Church of his time. Which if it were not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, he could not be infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the teſtimonie of the Church of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles time. Beſide, S. Auſtin sheweth, that he meaneth of the authoritie of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152999:119"/> preſent Church, in ſaying: <hi>The Catholik authoritie doth commend to me both books alike.</hi> And l. 1. contra Creſcon. c. 33. <hi>The truth of Scripture is held, when we doe, what now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the whole Church.</hi> Which is plainly ment of the preſent Church. The ſame S. Auſtin (as is before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſaieth, l. 10. de Gen. ad literam c. 23. That baptiſme of Infants were not to be beleued, <hi>vnles it were an Apoſtolical tradition.</hi> And l. 2. de ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmo c. 4. that he durſt not defend the baptiſme giuen by heretiks, <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he were aſſured by the authoritie of the Church.</hi> Therfore he thought the authoritie of the Church neceſſarie to beleue thoſe points of faith.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, becaus nether Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor reading of Scripture, is a neceſſarie cauſe of engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring faith, in ordinarie courſe. Therfore the preaching of the Church is ſuch a means. For there is (doubtles) ſome ordinarie means inſtituted by God, which in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe is neceſſarie, and if not Scripture, nor reading of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſurely the Church and her prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. For no other can be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly imagined. The Antecedent I
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152999:121"/> proue, becaus (as I ſaied before) for manie ages before Moyſes, there was no Scripture at al, nor for ſome yeares after Chriſt, was there anie Scripture of the new Teſtament, and in S. Ireneys time, no Scripture, amongſt ſome Barbarians, and yet there wanted not then, ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie means of getting faith. For there were faithful men in al thoſe times, and places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Preachers or Paſtors are neceſſarie to the Church in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe. Therfore preaching alſo is neceſſarie. The conſequent is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For why should preachers be neceſſarie, if preaching (for which preachers are) be not? The Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is cleare, both out of manie places in Scripture, and out of the definition of the Church, where Miniſters of the word and of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are put, as an eſſential parte of the Church, where nether Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor reading of it, is put as anie parte thereof; and alſo, out of the confeſſions of Proteſtants, as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:152999:121"/> we shal ſee in the next Chapter. If anie ſay, that before Scripture was written, Gods ordinarie means, and neceſſarie for vs, was preaching, but after Scripture was written, the reading of it, is the neceſſarie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie means of faith: Firſt I anſwer: he voluntarily ſaieth, that God hath changed his neceſſarie ordinarie means of cauſing faith. Secondly, Scripture neuer can be the vniuerſal neceſſarie means of cauſing faith, becaus it cannot be ſuch to blinde men, or to ſuch as cannot read, nay nor to anie that vnderſtand it not in the original toungs, according to the opinion of Proteſtants. Beſids, <note place="margin">See l. 2 c. 2. ſect. 2.</note> it is abſurd to ſay, that after Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God had altered his ordinarie neceſſarie means of engendring faith.

For (as is euident by their confeſſions relate din the fourteenth Chapter) commonly they teach, that the teſtimonie of the Church is neceſſarie to beleue the Scripture to be the word of God, and that it cannot be known to be ſuch, by its own light alone: and yet they proue

For the Scripture doth infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirme the authoritie of the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, but tradition doth but morally and probably confirme the authoritie of the Scripture.</hi> But firſt, it is fals, that the Church doth but probably confirme the authoritie of the Scripture. For (as we haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before) the Churches teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is a ſufficient external and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial means to beget diuine faith: and the holie Fathers alſo proued ſufficiently the diuine veritie of Scripture (againſt ſuch as denied anie parte of it) by the authoritie of the Church: and it were to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the credit of Scripture to the laughter of Infidels, to ſay, that it cannot be proued otherwiſe, then probably, and that al Chriſtian faith of what is in ſcripture, relieth vpon
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152999:142"/> onely probable proof, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Seeſup. c. 8. n. 13.</note> is the word of God. Beſids, it is euidently fals, and no way proued, that after the Church hath proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proued; that the Scripture is the word of God, the Scripture it ſelf sheweth a clear light, that it is the the word of God. For that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſuch a clear light, ether before the Churches teſtimonie, or after, is merely faigned without al proof; and if it had, it would not cauſe faith in vs, that it is the word of God (becaus faith is of things not appearing) but ſcience or knowledg. Moreouer, ſeing Laude and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants generally confeſſ, that the Church is infallible in fundamental points, they cannot conſequently ſay, that she is not infallible in this point, <hi>That the Scripture is the word of God</hi> becaus they account this, the <note place="margin">Hooker l. 1. §. 14.

And what is infallible, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an infallible, and more then a moral and probable proof. Beſids, this circle were vicious, becaus the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152999:142"/> proof were not equal on ether ſide. For on the Scriptures ſide, it were infallible, and on the Churches ſide, but fallible. And we ask for an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proof of Scripture, as wel as of the Church, becaus we muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſured of both: and to giue vs a fallible proof of the Scripture by the Church, were to delude vs. Finally I ask, if the Scripture, doe infallibly confirme the tradition of the Church (as Laude ſaieth) how doth the tradition of the Church onely probably confirme the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Scripture? can not that, which is infallibly, proued or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, make an infallible proof of ſome other thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Catholiks far more clearly auoid al vicious circles: (For euerie circular proof, is not vicious, but that onely, wherby our knowledg is no way bettered: For the effect may be proued a priori, or <hi>propter quid,</hi> by the cauſe, and the cauſe, a poſteriori, or <hi>quia,</hi> by the effect) and ſay, that our diuine faith of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152999:143"/> Church, nether firſt riſeth, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the certaine of the Scripture, but onely is confirmed by the Scripture; but that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the Scripture, both firſt riſeth, and ſtil dependeth (for vs) on the authoritie of the Church. For the true Church of God (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer she is) was beleued more then two thouſand yeares before there was anie Scripture, and she hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authoritie to teſtifie of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This we proue by al the waies, by which we proued, that she is a ſufficient propoſer of al points of faith. For if of al, euen of herſelf, that she is the true Church. For this is a point (and a principal one) of faith. Beſids, the foreſaid proofs not onely proue, that she is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient propoſer of points of faith, but alſo, that she is ſuch of herſelf, or of her own authoritie giuen to her by God. For if of her preaching, faith riſeth, if she be the pillar and ground of truth, if she be a witnes apointed by God, if her voice be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:152999:143"/> one with the voice of Chriſt, her authoritie is diuine, and she is, euen for herſelf, to be beleued, as the Apoſtles were to be beleued for <note place="margin">Sup. c. 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Fathers alſo, who by her authoritie proued the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt ſuch heretiks, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, and (as they thought) ſufficiently and infallibly, ſurely did think, that she was to be beleued for her own authoritie. For by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, they could not proue her, againſt ſuch as denied Scripture. Reaſon alſo confirmeth the ſame. For if a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt be to be beleued for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, why not the Spouſe of Chriſt, one miſtical perſon with him, whoſe head he is and whoſe ſoule, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt?

As in matters known by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſome are intelligible by them ſelues: ſo in matters of beleef, ſome are credible by themſelues, els there wold be an endles proceſſ in ſuch matters. Beſide, ſome are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes without al exception, and if anie be ſuch, ſurely the true Church of God, and witneſſes without al
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:152999:145"/> exception, are credible for them ſelues. But here we muſt beware of being deceaued, becaus as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants grant to the Church no other authoritie, then humane, ſo they can grant her to be beleued for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with no other kinde of faith, then humane. Wheras, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had two kinds of authorities, the one humane, as they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous men, the other diuine, as they were ſpecially aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the holie Ghoſt: ſo the true Church of God hath the ſame two kinds of authorities: humane, as it is ſo ancient, ſo great, ſo learned, ſo vertuous a companie of men; and diuine, as it is ſpecially aſſiſted by the holie Ghoſt in al matters of faith And ſo she is to be beleued for her ſelf, both with humane and diuine faith, as the Apoſtles were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued: and the humane authoritie, is no doubt, a great diſpoſition to the beleef of the diuine authoritie. And ſurely, ſith we muſt needs grant that ether the true Church of God
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:152999:145"/> is credible with diuine faith, that she is the true Church of God, for her ſelf, or that theſe Copies which we haue written by fallible men, are credible for themſelues, that they are the word of God and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their originals, no man of iudgment can think, but that rather the Church of God is ſo credible for herſelf, then ſuch copies, as we haue, written by fallible men. For beſide al other proofes, theſe Copies nether doe, nor can teſtifie of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are the word of God, or agreable to the original writings of the Prophets or Apoſtles as the true Church of God, both can and doth teſtifie of herſelf, that she is the true Church of God, and the ſame with that which was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it is euident, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, prouing to themſelues the Church, by the Scripture, and the Scripture, by the Church, commit no vicious Circle: For they firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the Church, by her own diuine
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:152999:146"/> authoritie, and likewiſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the ſame authoritie and they doe but confirme the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church, by the Scripture. And to heretiks, who denie the true Church, but admit the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as did the Donatiſts) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the Church by the Scripture and to other Heretiks, who denie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as did the Manichees) they proue the Scripture by the Church. And therfore, in prouing the Church, and the Scripture, one by the other, commit no vitious Circle ether in their proof to themſelues, or to Heretiks. For to themſelues, they proue the Scripture to be the word of God, by authoritie of the Church, as by the external and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie formal motiue of faith; and confirme their beleef of the Church by the Scripture, as by a material obiect of faith, which is the word of God. So that two waies they auoid a vitious Circle: firſt, becaus they firſt beleue the Church for her own authoritie, as for a ſecondarie
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:152999:146"/> and ſubordinat authoritie to Gods authoritie, and doe but confirme their beleef of the Church by the Scripture. So that beleef of the Scripture to be Gods word, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neceſſarily (in ordinarie cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe) of the Churches authoritie, but beleef of the Church, to be the Church of God, doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily depend vpon the teſtimonie of the Scripture, but onely is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therby Secondly, becaus they proue the Church by the Scripture, otherwiſe then they proue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Church. For they proue the Scripture, by the authoritie of the Church, as by a witnes, and as by the external formal motiue of faith, ſecondarie and ſubordinate to Gods authoritie: as the Primitiue Chriſtians, proued the Scripture by the authoritie of the Apoſtles; and they proue the Church by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as by a material obiect of faith which is Gods word, and not as by a witneſſ but as by a teſtimonie of a witnes. And to proue things by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:152999:147"/> Gods word, and by authoritie inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God, are different kinds of proofes, and shew, that there is no vitious Circle. If anie ſay, that we proue the Church by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Gods word: I anſwer, that authoritie properly, is of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and truth and veritie, is in his word: ſo we proue the Church, by the truth of Scripture; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we proue by the authoritie of the Church. And as for our proof alſo of the Church by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of the Scripture by the Church, to Heretiks, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no vitious circle, becaus we proceed ſo with different here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks. For to ſuch heretiks, as admit Scripture, but denie the Church, we proue the Church by Scripture: and to ſuch as admit the Church, but denie Scripture, we proue Scripture by the Church.</p>

               <p n="1">1. OVT of that which hath been hitherto ſaied, is clearly anſwered that queſtion: <hi>How or Wherfore we beleue or know the true Church of God to be abſolutly infallible in al which she teacheth, as matter of faith.</hi> Laude ſec. 16. p. 60. ſaieth: <hi>The tradition of the Church taken alone cannot be a ſufficient proof to beleue by diuine faith, that Scripture is the word of God. For that which is a ful and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof, is able of it ſelf, to ſettle the ſoule of man, which Tradition is not alone able to doe. For it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked, why we should beleue the Churches Tradition? And if it be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Becaus the Church is infallibly
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:152999:148"/> gouerned by the holie Ghoſt, it may be demanded: How that may appeare; And if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> be demanded, ether you muſt ſay you haue it by ſpecial Reuelation, or els you muſt attempt to proue it by Scripture. And the verie offer to proue it by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, is a ſufficient ackno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ledgment, that the Scripture is a higher proof, then the Churches tradition, which in your own ground, is or may be queſtionable, til you come thither. Beſids it is an inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground of reaſon, that the Principles of anie concluſion.</hi> Thus he, whoſe words I haue related at large that I might not ſeem to diſſemble the difficultie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Firſt therfore we muſt note, that <hi>Beleef</hi> and <hi>Knowledg</hi> are different. For <hi>Beleef,</hi> is a ſimple aſſent for the authoritie of the ſpeaker. <hi>Knowledg</hi> (if it be not of ſuch things as are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of themſelues, as that <hi>the whole is greater then a parte,</hi> and ſuch like) is diſcurſiue, inferring one thing out of an other. Therfore theſe are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent queſtions: <hi>Wherfore we know
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152999:149"/> the Church to be infallible in al matters of faith:</hi> and, <hi>Wherfore we beleue her to be ſo infallible:</hi> And we wil anſwer to both queſtions differently and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. To the queſtion: <hi>Wherfore we beleue the Chrch to be infallible:</hi> I anſwer that if you demand the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <note place="margin">Gods vocal word the material obiect of faith.</note> obiect of my beleef therof, it is Gods vocal word, vttered to me by the Church. For (as is shewed before out of the Apoſtle) <hi>Faith is of hearing,</hi> and, <hi>Hearing,</hi> is by the vocal word of God vttered by the Church. And for this vocal word of God as his teſtimonie, the Church was beleued to be infallible, before there was anie Scripture; and of the aforeſaied Barbarians, who had no Scripture; and could be ſo beleued, though al Scripture should perish. And this Luther, and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants before cited doe confeſſ, when they ſay: <hi>The Church is concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, bred by the vocal word of God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And if you ask the formal obiect, for whoſe authoritie we <hi>beleue</hi> the Church to be thus infallible? I
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152999:149"/> anſwer; For the authoritie of God, principally, and for the authoritie of the Church, (which is the pillar and ground of faith,) ſubordinatly. As we beleue what the Embaſſador ſaieth, principally, for the King, who ſent him, and ſubordinatly for the authoritie of the Embaſſador himſelf, as apointed by the king. And as before anie Scripture was written, Prophets were beleued, not for anie Scripture, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for the authoritie of God, who ſent them, and ſecondarily, for their own Prophetical authoritie, inſtituted by God. Wherfore we need not (as Laude thinketh) proue the Church to be infallible, ether by ſpecial reuelation, or by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as Chillingworth, ſaieth c. 3. p. 141. Becaus beſide the priuat word of God (which is by ſpecial reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and his publik written word, <note place="margin">Publik vocal word of God Videſup. c. 14. n. 1.</note> which is Scripture, there is alſo his publik vocal word, which he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and ſpeaketh by the mouth of the Church, as wel as there is his

And Gods word (by whom ſoeuer it is, ether ſpoke nor written) is of equal authoritie, and his vocal word, equally to be beleued, as his written. Wherfore we haue no need to proue the Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible by the Scripture (as there was no need, nor poſſibilitie by it, to proue that, or anie other point of faith, before anie Scripture, was written) vnles it be againſt ſuch he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, as beleue the Scripture, but beleue not the Church. But Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks doe onely confirme their faith (which before they had of the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie of the Church by Gods vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <note place="margin">Gods vocal word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his. written.</note> word vttered by the Church) by his written word of the Scripture.

               <p n="4">4. And moreouer it is not alwaies neceſſarie (as laude thinks) that the mean of knowing, be more known,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152999:150"/> then the thing known by it: as when they mutually make each other known, as Relatiues and the Cauſe and proper Effect doe. For in theſe, a Circle is not vitious. As from a Father, we proue a ſonn, and from a ſonn, à Father, From Rational, Riſible, and from Riſible, Rational; from the ſuns riſing, the Daie; and from the Daie, the ſuns riſing. And (as Whitaker ſaieth contr. 1. q. 3. c. 3. of the old and new Teſtament) <note place="margin">Somethings mutually proue each other.</note> 
                  <hi>The old and new Teſtament doe mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirme one the other.

Inſtit. c. 9. §. 3. <hi>God hath ioyned together the certaintie of his word and Spirit, with a mutual knot.</hi> The ſameſay I of Gods vocal word, vttered by the Church, and his written word, ſigned by the Euangeliſts, that they mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme each other: yet with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the true Church giueth ſufficient teſtimonie to her ſelf, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient (I ſay) to beleue her with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine faith, to be the true Church of God, becaus her authoritie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, is diuine, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was, and therfore needeth not the teſtimonie of the Scripture to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152999:151"/> be beleued to be ſuch: (as Chriſt gaue ſufficient teſtimonie to himſelf Ioan. 5. S. Ihon Baptiſt to himſelf. <note place="margin">If particular men were credible of themſelues, why not the whole Church of God.</note> Math. 3. S. Ihon Euangeliſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Ioan. 21. and S. Paul to himſelf Galat. 1. 2. Cor. 4. and ſo doth the pillar and ground of truth, to her ſelf.) But the Scripture giueth not ſufficient teſtimonie of it ſelf to be infallibly beleued to be Gods word, but needeth authoritie of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Author, or Perſon; becaus Scripture is onely the material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which is to be beleued, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is the formal obiect or cauſe of beleef, without which there can be no true or formal beleef, but onely ſcience or opinion. For as S. Auſtin ſaieth: <hi>That we beleue, we owe to authoritie.</hi> And Whitaker l. 3. de Script. p. 408. <hi>Faith relieth vpon au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Authoritie is the foundation of faith.</hi> Yet Scripture being beleued to be Gods word, is a ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to confirme the beleef alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had of the Church, and alſo to produce ſuch beleef in thoſe, who
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152999:152"/> beleue not the Church. And thus much for anſwer to that queſtion: <hi>How we beleue the Church to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> For we firſt beleue the Church <note place="margin">God ſpeaketh by, the mouth of the Church Vvhitaker l. 3 de Scrip 414. ſo alſo Contr. 1 q. 3. c. 11. ſee c. 4. n. 4. and c. 14. n. 1.</note> to be infallible, for Gods vocal word vttered by the Church: And we are confirmed in that beleef, for Gods written word in the Scripture. And to Catholiks, we giue Gods vocal word, as the firſt ſubordinat cauſe of that our beleef; but to ſuch, as beleue the Scripture, and not the Church, we giue onely Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word. And therfore no maruel, if to Proteſtants, who admit not the authoritie of Gods Church, or his vocal word, we proue the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Church, onely by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; wheras if they did equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as wel Gods vocal word, as his written word, or his true Church, as his Scripture, we might, without anie vitious Circle at al, mutually proue Gods vocal word by his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, and his written, by his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and his Church by his Scripture, and his Scripture by his Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152999:152"/> Gods teſtimonie is ſufficient for proof of whatſoeuer, and by what means ſoeuer it be vttered, to wit, by ſpeech, by writing, or howſoeuer els. Wherfore this is no vitious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: God ſaieth by his Church, that <note place="margin">God ſpeaketh by his Church, Vvhitaker ſupra.</note> ſuch Scripture is his word. Therfore it is ſo. God ſaieth by his Scripture, that ſuch are his Church: Therfore they are ſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as for anſwer to the queſtion: <hi>How know you the true Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in al matters of faith?</hi> I ſay, that beſide the reaſons, grounded in Scripture, giuen before, we may giue a natural reaſon therof. For (as S. Auſtin ſaieth rightly (If God haue <note place="margin">L. de v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And this authoritie muſt not be blinde or deceiptful in matters of ſaluation (as al matters of faith are) as al fallible authoritie is, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is infallible in al ſuch matters: And (as the ſame S. Auſtin ſaieth of the Scripture, that if the leſt lie be
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152999:153"/> found in it, the authoritie of al the reſt faileth: ſo if in the authoritie, which God hath ſetled on earth for matters of Saluation, there were found anie error, we could not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely relie vpon it. And the ſame reaſon teacheth vs, that if God would ſetle this infallible authoritie on earth in anie, he would ſetle it in his Church who is his beloued Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and Mother of the Faithful, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he hath apointed to conceaue them by the diuine ſeed of his word to beare, nourish, and guide them in their way to ſaluation. For who can be imagined to be more fit to be infallible in matters of Saluation, then the ſpouſe of God, the mother, Nurſe, and Guide of the Faithful? Would God apoint to mankinde a blinde or deceiptful guide to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? ſurely no, if he effectually meant to ſaue mankinde. Nether, wil it ſuffice to grant, (as Proteſtants doe) that the Church is infallible in fundamental points: firſt, becaus there are no fundamental points <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becaus if (as S. Auſtin ſaied of the Scripture) she lie in ſome points of faith, we cannot be ſure she doth not in others. Wherfore wel ſaied Chillingworth c. 3. n. 36. <hi>An autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſubiect to error, can be no ſtable or firme foundation of my beleef in anie thing.</hi> Thirdly, becaus Proteſtants cannot tel, which preciſely are ſuch fundamental points, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and therfore cannot be certain, in which points the Church erreth not. Fourthly, becaus they ſay the Church is fallible euen in their moſt fundamental point of al, which is, <hi>That Scripture is the word of God,</hi> and ſometimes alſo, in other fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, as is shewed parte 1. l. 1. c. 7. Fiftly, Chillingworth denieth, that there is anie one certain Church, vniuerſal or particular, which is infallible, euen in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, but onely, that there are alwaies ſome vncertain men,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152999:154"/> who hold al the fundamental points and therfore denieth, that anie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Church is an infallible Guide euen in fundamentals: and ſaieth c. 2 n 139. p. 105. <hi>you muſt know, there is a wide difference between infallible in</hi>

               <p n="7">7. And out of al which hath been ſaid in this Chapter, appeareth, how
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:152999:155"/> wrongfully Laude ſaid, firſt, that we muſt know the Church to be infallible ether by ſpecial reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or by Scripture. For there is a third way, to wit, by Gods vocal word vttered by the Church it ſelf, as when the Apoſtles liued, we might haue known them to be infallible, by their own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, which was Gods vocal word. Secondly, he falſly ſaieth, that to proue the Church by the Scripture, is a ſufficient acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; that the Scripture is of a higher proof. For Chriſt and the Apoſtles proued their doctrin out of the old teſtament, and yet the old teſtament was not a higher proof then their doctrin. And in like ſorte the Fathers proued Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (as I ſaid before) Relatiues, and ſuch as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and equally make each other known, are of equal proof, each to other. Thirdly, how wrongly he ſaied, that it is <hi>an inuiolable ground of reaſon, that the principles
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152999:156"/> of anie concluſion muſt be of more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, then the concluſion it ſelf.</hi> For this is not true in Relatiues, and ſuch others, as are equally known and equally infer one the other. And that principle is true onely in ſuch Conſequents, as are not as wel known, as the Antecedents, but known onely for the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as moſt conſequents are, as may appeare out of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, of which that principle dependeth, to wit: <hi>Propter quod vnumquodque tale, &amp; illud magis.</hi> Which is plainly meant of that, which is the ſole cauſe of the knowlegd of an other.

IN the third Chapter we she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that foure conditions are neceſſarie to the al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Propoſer of al points of faith, to wit, <hi>Infallibilitie, Neceſsitie, Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and <hi>Vniuerſalitie:</hi> and hitherto we haue proued, that the true Church of God hath the two firſt conditions It remaineth that we alſo shew, that she hath alſo the two latter, to wit, <hi>Claritie</hi> in clearly propoſing, what is to be beleued, and <hi>Vniuerſalitie,</hi> in propoſing it to al, who are capable of external propoſal, and in al ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and places, where faith is to be propoſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And for <hi>Claritie,</hi> it is euident, that the Church of God clearly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:152999:157"/> enough propoſeth to her Children, and to others, what they are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, and if anie doubt ariſe of her meaning, she calleth General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and expreſſeth it more clearly, as was ſeen in the Councel of Nice, ad others. And as for <hi>Vniuerſalitie of time and place,</hi> it is euident, that it agreeth to Gods true Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus she hath been in al times, and is diſperſed al the world ouer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer faith is preached. And the like is of her propoſing al points of faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And finally, that in the true Church, is lawful ſending to preach points of faith, is vndoubted. And ſo haue we proued, that the true Church of God (which ſoeuer she is) hath al the conditions requiſit to the al or abſolute ſufficient external propoſer of al points of diuine faith, which God wil haue men to beleue, and conſequently, is that al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient external propoſer of faith, which we ought to ſeek.</p>

Secondly, one may be ſaued, though the beleue not the Scripture to be the word of God. Thirdly, books of Scripture are not ſo much obiects of our faith, as inſtruments therof. Fourthly, are not ſo much of the being of Chriſtian faith, as of the wel being of it. Fiftly, God requires not vnder pain of damnation, to beleue the diuine authoritie of Scripture. Sixtly, we beleue not the Scripture finally and for it ſelf. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently, It is not the laſt obiect of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:152999:201"/> faith. Eightly, natural reaſon is the laſt reſolution of Proteſtants faith of the Scripture. Ninthly Laicks beleue their doctrin to be in the Scripture, but with humane faith. And can that, which is ſuch, be the formal cauſe, the chief principle, or ground of faith, and into which diuine faith is reſolued?</p>

That Scripture, taken by it ſelf alone, vvithout atteſtation of the Church, that it is the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or vvord of God, cannot ſufficiently propoſe to men anie thing to be beleued vvith diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and infallible faith.</head>

THat Scripture, taken by it ſelf alone without atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Church, that it is the letter or word of God, doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſe to vs, or (to ſpeak more properly) that in Scripture, or by Scripture alone, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to vs, anie thing to be beleued with diuine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith, is euident, becaus al the Scriptures ſufficient propoſal <note n="a" place="margin">Sup c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:152999:209"/> where, that it is the word of God, and if it did anie where ſay it, that ſaying would require an other word of God to ſay the ſame of it, and ſo forward without end. And this is ſo clear, as Hooker l. 2. §. 4. Laude Relat. ſec. 16. p. 70. and 88. Potter ſec. 5. and Chillingworth c. 2. doe both grant it, and proue it, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe al other <note n="c" place="margin">Sup. c. 6. ſect. 2.</note> Proteſtants, who grant, that the light of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is not ſo great, that without the Church shew it to vs, we can ſee it. And indeed al Proteſtants should grant the ſame, who confeſſ (as we related l. 1. c. 14.) that the preaching of the Church, is neceſſarie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender diuine faith. For if that be neceſſarie (as we haue proued l. 1. c. 11. 12. 13. 14.) we cannot beleue the Scripture to be the word of God before the Church preach it to vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is againſt thoſe Proteſtants who (as we related ſupra c. 6. ſec. 1.) auouch, that Scripture in it ſelf hath ſuch and ſo much diuine light, as by it ſelf alone, it can be infallibly known
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:152999:209"/> to be the word of God. But beſide, that this great light is denied by moſt of their fellowes, as is shewed c. 6. cit. ſec. 2. and feigned without al ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground (as shal hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) it may be clearly refuted. For as Laude loco cit. p. 7. ſaieth wel <hi>If this inward light were ſo clear, how could there haue been anie varietie among the ancient Beleuers, touching the authoritie of S. Iames, and S. Iudes epiſtle, and the Apocalyps? For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the light which is in the Scripture, was the ſame then, which is now.</hi> And I add: How could the Lutherans not ſee this light in S. Iames Epiſtle, as wel as the Caluiniſts? Nether can it be pretended, that this is, becaus the Holie Ghoſt doth not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lighten their eyes, becaus this light may be ſeen euen by natural reaſon, as Whitaker, Hooker, White and other taught ſupra c. 8. ſec. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſids, this light (great or leſſ) is not fit or apt to the end for which it was feigned. For it was feigned to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:152999:210"/> defend, that beleif, <hi>That Scripture is the word of God</hi> dependeth not on the teſtimonie of the Church, but proceedeth of the Scripture it ſelf. And clear light cannot cauſe beleif <note place="margin">Light cauſeth not faith, but ſight or viſion.</note> (which is of <hi>things not appearing,</hi> Hebrewes 11.) but onely cauſeth certain knowledg or viſion. And not light, but onely authoritie, is the formal obiect of faith. For (as the Apoſtle ſaieth: <hi>Faith is of hearing,</hi> not of ſight. And S. Auſtin l. devtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Credendi c. 11.) <hi>That we beleue, we owe to authoritie.</hi> So that light, wanteth both the material obiect of faith, which is <hi>Things not appearing,</hi> Haebrae. 11. and alſo the formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which is <hi>Authoritie.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Whitaker l. 2. de Script. p. 227. 319. 235. l. 1. p. 77. 116. 122. often ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes granteth, that though certain knowledg, (That the Scripture is the word of God) may be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the teſtimonie of the Church, yet denieth, that diuine faith therof can be had without the Churches preaching, becaus the Apoſtle ſaieth
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:152999:210"/> plainly, <hi>How shal they beleue without à Preacher? And, Faith is of hearing.</hi> And Potter ſec. 5. p. 8. <hi>That Scripture is of diuine authoritie, the Beleuer ſees by that glorious beam of diuine light, which shines in Scripture, and by manie internal arguments found in the letter it ſelf.</hi> So this light breedeth <hi>ſight,</hi> not faith.

If therfore the Scripture can ſufficiently propoſe nothing to be beleued with diuine faith, til it ſelf be beleued with diuine faith to be the word of God (as is certain) the natural, knowledg or viſion, which one may haue, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the word of God without the Churches teſtimonie, ſerueth not to the end, for which it was deuiſed. Beſids, I hope, they wil not ſay, that their diuine faith, <hi>That al that is in Scripture, is true,</hi> is reſolued into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <note place="margin">Sup c. 8 ſe. 1.</note> knowledg, <hi>That the Scripture is the word of God,</hi> as Chillingworth ſeemeth to ſay c. 2. p. 53. 72. For ſo the ground and foundation of diuine and infallible faith, should be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:152999:211"/> humane, and fallible knowledg. Moreouer, this internal light, is no word of God, but (at moſt) a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the word of God: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be the material obiect of diuine faith and beleued, but what is the word of God, or ſaied of God; Wherfore ether they muſt shew, where God hath ſaied, that Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is the word of God; or they can neuer beleue it with diuine faith; or they muſt ſay, that they can bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that with diuinefaith, which God hath neuer ſaied, which is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. And into this abſurditie, al Proteſtants muſt fal, who ſay, they beleue with diuine faith, that the Scripture is the word of God, and yet denie, that there is anie vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God, which ſaieth, <hi>That the Scripture is the word of God.</hi>

And alſo, becaus the words of Scripture are ſuch, as men firſt inuented, and haue no diuine light in them. Likewiſe, if the light
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:152999:212"/> were onely in the original letters of Scripture, as Hebrew, and Greek, no tranſlated Scripture should haue this light, and ſo none should know the Scripture to be Gods word, but who know Hebrew and Greek.

                  </gap>. ſaieth, <hi>Nether doe I put moſt certain diuinitie in the written letter.</hi> And ſurely writing or letters giue no diuine authoritie to Gods word. For Gods word is of the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, written and vnwritten, as is euident, and Proteſtants confeſſ. How then can writing or letters giue anie true light or brightnes to Gods word? Finally, I add, that <note place="margin">e Sup l 1. c. 10. n. 6.</note> faith cannot be reſolued into argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becaus it is not diſcurſiue,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:152999:212"/> but onely into authoritie. For it is a ſimple aſſent to the ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the authoritie of the ſaier. And onely the word of God, or which God hath ſaid, can be beleued with diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne faith. And no collection or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of man out of the character or letter of God, is Gods word, and therfore cannot be the obiect or formal cauſe of diuine faith. Nor is this feigned light in the ſenſe of the Scripture, becaus then by it, we could not beleue euerie parte of the Scipture to be Gods word For (as Proteſtants before confeſſed) it <note place="margin">Sup. c. 2. ſect. 2.</note> were impudencie and madnes to ſay, that anie know the true ſenſe of euerie parte of Scripture, which is beleued to be Gods word. S. Auſtin Epiſt. 119. profeſſed, that there is more in Scripture, which he knew not, then which he knew. And Whitaker l. 2. de Script<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 220. 235. ſaieth; <hi>The Eunuch, though he vnderſtood not the Scriptures, yet he acknowledged them and certainly knew them to be diuine.</hi> And l. 1. p.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:152999:213"/> 156. <hi>God hath ſo framed his ſpeech, that though pious men doe not alwaies clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee what he ſpeaketh, yet they clearly ſee by the verie ſpeech, that it is God who ſpeaketh.</hi> What diuine light of honeſtie, haue thoſe words to Oſee, <hi>Take a fornicarian, and make ſonnes of fornication?</hi> What diuine light of humanitie, haue thoſe words to Abraham: ſacrifice thy ſonne? what diuine light of truth haue thoſe words, that Balaams aſſ ſpake to him? And the like of manie more? 5. Furthermore, the Deuiſers of this ſufficient internal light of the Scripture, are not wel reſolued, whether not withſtanding this light, it need be proued infallibly, that Scripture is the word of God. For Laude ſec. 16. p. 64<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaieth: <hi>It ſeemes to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>This is agreed on by me, that ſcripture muſt be known to be ſcripture, by a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient infallible diuine proof, And that

Which if he wold conſtantly hold, he muſt needs grant, that there is ſome vnwritten word of God, by which the Scripture muſt be proued to be his word.

                  <hi>reaſonable, that Theologie should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to haue ſome principle, which she proues not, but preſuppoſes; and the chiefeſt, of theſe is, Tat the ſcriptures are of diuine authoritie.</hi> And the ſame he repeateth p. 110. Potter alſo ſec. 5. p. 26. <hi>Al Chriſtians in the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ the authoritie of ſcripture to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple indemonſtrable, yet are we by them</hi> (Papiſts) <hi>perpetually vrged to proue that authoritie, and that by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And Whitaker l 1. de Script. 106. <hi>What Paſtor euer laboreth to proue that it is God, who ſpeaketh in ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res?
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:152999:214"/> He by his right, requireth, that this be granted to him.</hi> So that the chiefeſt principle of Proteſtants Theologie, and that on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth their beleif of al they bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, cannot be infallibly proued, but muſt be praeſuppoſed, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted: and conſequently, they can beleue nothing infallibly, as Laude p. 64. cit. wel inferred. For (as generally Proteſtants teach) we <note place="margin">Sup. l. 1. c. 18. n. 1.</note> can haue no greater certaintie of the inference, then we haue of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple out of which we inferr it. And herevpon Chillingworth (as befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re we shewed c. 8. ſec. 2.) conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently granted, that Proteſtants haue but humane and moral aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what they beleue: And (as Laude ſaieth ſec. 16. p. 59.) This queſtion; <hi>how doe you know ſcripture to be ſcripture?</hi> driueth ſome of them into infidelitie. Such fruits they ſee come of their denying the Churches infallibilitie in al matters of faith.</p>
               <p>6. Finally, this ſufficient internal light of the Scripture (great or leſſ)
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:152999:214"/> hath no ſufficient ground. For the pretended ground therof, is, that the Scripture is called a light pſal. 118. To which I anſwer, Firſt, That arguments taken from Metaphors <note place="margin">Arguments taken from me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aphors, are deceitful.</note> or ſimilitudes, are moſt ſubiect to deceipt, becaus the true ſimilitude may be eaſily miſtaken. Secondly, it is not ſaied, that the <hi>ſcripture</hi> or <hi>Written word,</hi> and much leſſ, <hi>Al ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is a light, but ſimply: <hi>The word of God,</hi> which may be wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ether of the <hi>word preached.</hi> Gal. 1. Without which there is no faith, Rom. 10. or of the <hi>ingrafted word, which can ſaue our ſoules.</hi> Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi 1. or of the <hi>word written in the hearts of the faithful.</hi> Hierem. 31. Thirdly I ſay, that the word of God is called a light, not becaus it she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <note place="margin">Vvhy Gods word called a light.</note> it ſelf to be the word of God, as light sheweth it ſelf to be light, but becaus it sheweth the way to heauen. And therfore it is called a light to our feet, which can not ſee but follow. And in this ſorte Iob. 2. 29. ſaieth: <hi>He was an eye to the blinde,</hi>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:152999:215"/> not that the blinde could ſee him but follow his directions. The like I ſay to that other place 2. Petri, c. 1. Where he likeneth <hi>Prophetical ſpeech to a lamp shining in a dark place.</hi> For nether ſpeaketh he of al <hi>ſcripture,</hi> but onely of <hi>Propheſies,</hi> nether like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he them to a lamp, in that this is ſeen by it ſelf, but ether becaus Propheſies gaue but a darkſome light of Chriſt, in reſpect of the Goſpel, or becaus they directed to Chriſt, as a lamp directeth in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome roome. In like ſorte, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were called the light of the world. Math. 5. Not becaus the world could ſee them to be Apoſtles of themſelues, but becaus they gaue to others the light of faith and pietie And thus much for this firſt proof, that Scripture cannot ſufficiently shew it ſelf to be the word of God, for want of the material obiect of diuine faith, which is Gods ſaying, <hi>that it is his word.</hi> For God no where ſaieth in Scripture, that Scripture is his word, and what God faieth
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:152999:215"/> diuine faith cannot beleue.</p>
               <p>7. An other argument to the ſame purpoſe, may be taken from the Scriptures not hauing in it ſelf the formal obiect of faith, which is <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</hi> For albeit Scripture in it ſelf contein moſt diuine and infallible veritie, yet taken by it ſelf, as it is ſuch words, and ſuch ſenſe, it hath not proper authoritie, becaus <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,</hi> is in an <hi>Author,</hi> and an <hi>Author</hi> is a Rational, or intellectual Perſon, ſaying ſomething, which for his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or credit, we beleue. And <hi>Veritie,</hi> which we beleue, is in his ſpeech, <hi>Authoritie</hi> or <hi>Veracitie,</hi> for which we beleue is in his perſon. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe we cannot beleue, but for ſome witnes, who teſtifieth that, which we are to beleue: and a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, doubtles, is an intellectual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, diſtinct from his teſtimonie, or that which he witneſſeth. And Scripture is no intellectual perſon, but the teſtimonie of God, who is ſupreme witnes of it. Wherfore it is no formal cauſe of our beleef, as a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:152999:216"/> witnes is, but onely the material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which is to be beleued. Beſids, the Character or ſtile of Scripture, or the doctrin or maieſtie therof, being not authoritie or veracitie, they cannot cauſe formal faith, or beleif, but (at moſt) opinion or knowledg. For (as we haue often repeated out of S. Auſtin) <hi>That we beleue, we owe to Authoritie.</hi> Which is ſo euident, as Whitaker l. 3 de Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura p. 408. ſaieth, <hi>Faith relieth vpon authoritie. Authoritie is the foundation of faith.</hi> And p. 509. <hi>To beleue, ſome Authoritie is neceſſarie.</hi> Wherfore wel wrote Stapleton Contro. 3. q. 1. art. 2. <hi>The word of God it ſelf (written or vnwritten) is not of it ſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly à mean to beleue, but is that which is beleued: Is not the formal obiect of faith, or anie parte therof, but is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial obiect. For the word ſpeaketh not but is heard by the voice of God, or of the Church ſpeaking, and faith is of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God. And therfore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Scripturam credimus, non Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae.</hi> And in like manner, Potter ſec.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:152999:216"/> 7. p. 95. ſaieth: <hi>The Creed conteines onely the material obiect of faith, not the formal.</hi> And yet it conteines the words and ſenſe of Scripture. Wherfore the Scripture it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not the formal obiect of faith, but onely the material, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine veritie. And when graue Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors attribute authoritie to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ether they take authoritie for veritie or credibilitie to be beleued; or they ſpeak figuratiuely, attrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So we ſay, the Scripture ſpeaketh, ſaieth, teacheth, and ſuch like, meaning, God by the Scripture doth ſo. Or els they take not Scripture by it ſelf, but with the writer therof. And ſo (no doubt) it hath authoritie, not in it ſelf, but adioined to it, to wit, as it is the Scripture of God, or word of God: But this authoritie is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create authoritie of God himſelf, beſide which, we muſt haue (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

But to admit, that the original hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, known to be theirs, had authoritie ſufficient to beget diuine faith, how can mere copies of their writings, and thoſe made by fallible men (as al Bibles now extant are made by

And wil we haue mere copies of the Prophets or Apoſtles writings made by fallible and ordinarie men, to be of themſelues alone, of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient credit to beget diuine faith? can not vndoubted humane faith be gotten by ſuch mere copies not atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by anie authentical perſon; and can vndoubted diuine faith becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch? copies made by fallible men cannot reaſonably be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted infallible vnles they be atteſted by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me infallible perſon; and it is the atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the infallible perſon, which maketh them infallibly credible to vs. Wherfore out of that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:152999:218"/> which I haue hitherto ſaid, I argue <note place="margin">Vvhat is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial obiect of faith, is not the formal.</note> thus in forme. What is onely thema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial obiect of faith, or is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued, cannot be alſo the formal obiect of faith, and the reaſon of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing. That which is the word of God (written or vnwritten) is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the material obiect of faith, and what is beleued. Therfore it can not be alſo the formal obiect, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of beleuing. The Maior is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Minor I proue, becaus the word of God, taken by it ſelf, hath no formal authoritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal authoritie, is the formal obiect of faith, and reaſon of beleuing. And here is the difference betwixt the word of God, and the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Church of God, that theſe haue formal diuine authoritie in themſelues, and therfore are not onely material obiects of faith, and beleued to be Prophets, Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Difference between Scripture and Church.</note> and Church of God, but alſo are formal external reaſons of beleuing what they ſay themſelues are, or what els they propoſe.</p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:152999:218"/>
               <p>8. A third proof, that Scripture of it ſelf cannot ſufficiently propoſe it ſelf to be the word of God, is, becaus the authoritie of the true Church, is the formal external cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, for which (in ordinarie courſe) the Scripture is beleued with diuine faith to be the word of God. This is euident out of thoſe places in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we cited before l. 1. c. 11. and 12. which not onely proue the neceſſitie of the Churches preaching the Scripture to be Gods word, for to be beleued as ſuch, but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the verie authoritie of the Church to be neceſſarie for to beleue it. For faith is ſaid to be of hearing of the word of God lawfully preached: The Church is called the pillar and ground of truth: she is accounted Gods witnes, her voice, Chriſts voice; her Paſtors are accounted Gods Legats, and apointed by God to keep men conſtant in faith. Al which doe shew, not onely that the Churches preaching is neceſſarie to beleue, but that alſo her <hi>authoritie

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:152999:222"/> by the Scripture. For example, the doctrin of ſeauen Sacraments, which we haue by tradition, is no more credible of itſelf, then anie other point of faith, which we haue by Scripture: But if we ſpeak formally of Tradition, as it is an act of the Church, that is of itſelf credible, becaus that includeth the deliuerie of doctrin by the liuelie or liuing voice of the Church. Which voice of the Church, is euident to vs, and her authoritie maketh the doctrin, which she deliuereth, credible. But the Scripture is deliuered to vs by dead letters, and it is not euident to vs, that the Prophets or Apoſtles were the Enditers of thoſe letters: and therfore it hath not their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie adioined to it, as the voice of the Church hath her authoritie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined to it: and ſo the Scripture, not hauing the authoritie of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors therof ſo annexed to it, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath the authoritie of the Church, it can not be ſo credible of itſelf. Hence alſo is anſwered that

Chriſt and his word, include not al that is neceſſarie (in ordinarie courſe) to diuine faith, becaus <hi>faith is of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring à lawful Preacher Rom.</hi> 10. But faith in his Church includeth al that is (in ordinarie courſe) neceſſarie to diuine faith. For we can not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Chriſts Church, but we muſt beleue in Chriſts and in his word: Heretiks ſay, they beleue in Chriſt and in his word, but that wil not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them, becaus they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue <note place="margin">Vhoſoeuer beloue in Chriſt Church beleue in Christ, but not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewiſe.</note> alſo in his Church: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beleue in his Church, beleue in him, but not contrariwiſe, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beleue in Chriſt (ſo as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks

               <p>12. As for the authoritie of Fathers, to proue, that the Scripture of it ſelf without the atteſtation of the Church, can propoſe nothing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to be beleued with diuine faith, it may ſuffice, what before l. 1. c. 7. we cited out of S. Baſil, that Scripture, without tradition of the Church, would haue no force, but be like a bare letter: and out of S. Auſtin, that he could not beleue the Goſpel, if the authoritie of the Church were weakened, And as for Proteſtants confeſſions, it may alſo ſuffice, what we cited out of them l. 1. c. 14. and here l. 2. c. 5. and 6. <hi>That the Church is a neceſſarie introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the key the dore, which lets vs into the knowledg of the Scripture.</hi> And c. 5.

Who ſay, that Scripture may be known by reaſon and light of nature to be the word of God. So that the moſt neceſſarie, moſt ſure, prime, great, main ground of Proteſtants faith, is a principle of natural reaſon, and no obiect of diuine faith, or
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:152999:232"/> which we are bound to beleue vnder pain of damnation. Surely I ſee not, how Proteſtants can make agree theſe two main points of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin: <hi>There is no word of God vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, neceſſarie to be beleued</hi> and, <hi>That ſcripture is the word of God, is a word of God vnwritten, neceſſarie to be beleued.</hi> The firſt is the common doctrin of al Proteſtants, who therfore denie, that there is anie tradition, that is word of God vnwritten, neceſſarie to be beleued, and ſay, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the perfect and entire rule of faith, conteining al, that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be beleued. The ſecond alſo is their vſual doctrin. For that with them it is a word of God: <hi>That the Scripture is the word of God,</hi> is euident both becaus they put the Canon of Scripture in their Confeſſions of faith, as a parte of their beleif, and <note place="margin">Sup n. 7.</note> alſo becauſe Laude loco cit. calleth it <hi>a prime principle of faith;</hi> And Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her; <hi>That of al things, this ought to be beleued.</hi> And ſeing they ſay, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif of al other points dependeth on
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:152999:233"/> this, I ſuppoſe, they wil not denie this to be a point of faith, or Gods word, and ſay it is but a humane principle, or word of man. That this point is not written is euident. For no where it can be shewed: and alſo becauſe Laude, White and others cited ſupra c. 5. ſec. 2 confeſſ, that it is no where written in Scripture. And if it were anie where written, we could proue Scripture by itſelf, which Whitaker, Feild, Hooker, Couel, Chillingworth, and others cited c. 5. doe denie. And that they account this point neceſſarie to be beleued, I need not proue, becaus they account it the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie of al, and on which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whatſoeuer els they beleue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. An other proof, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not ſufficiently propoſe al points of faith, may be taken from the Proteſtants confeſſion, That they cannot deduce moſt of their points of faith, in which they differ from vs, out of Scripture by anie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie Inference; but by adding
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:152999:233"/> to Scripture ſome humane principle As they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not infer out of that ſaying of Scripture: <hi>Doe this in Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me,</hi> that the Euchariſt is not ſubſtantially the bodie of Chriſt, but by adding this humane principle, <hi>A Commemoration cannot be ſubſtantially the thing which is commemorated.</hi> And the like wil appeare in their proof of other their points of faith, if they be brought into ſyllogiſtical forme.

               <p n="1">1. THat Scripture doth not ſufficiently propoſe points of faith to al men, who are capable of external propoſal, is euident in the blinde, and thoſe who cannot
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:152999:234"/> read. For the blinde cannot ſo much as ſee the letters of the Scripture, and thoſe who cannot read, cannot ſee their ſignification, or what they ſignifie: Therfore Scripture of itſelf doth propoſe nothing ſufficiently vnto them. If anie anſwer, that Scripture may be read to them, and ſo propoſe ſufficiently to them, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: Firſt, that if Scripture cannot propoſe to them but by ſome others reading of it, of itſelf alone it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not propoſe, and ſo can be no Rule of faith to them, becaus a Rule nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no help to direct.

And the Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal were not infallible, if it vſed a fallible help. Surely the blinde or ignorant men, can haue no greater aſſurance, then moral, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:152999:235"/> readeth true. For what diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance can he be thought to haue in reading true? And it were madneſſ to ſay, he hath diuine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in reading true, and to denie that the true Church of God hath the like aſſiſtance in teaching true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And (as D. Potter ſaieth ſec. 5. p. 7.) <hi>The aſſent of diuine faith is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly diuine, which requires an obiect and motiue ſo infallibly true, as that it nether hath nor can poſsibly admit anie mixture of error or falshood.</hi> And he should haue ſaid; it cannot poſſibly admit <hi>anie mixture of fallibilitie.</hi> And doubtles anie particular mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is fallible: How then can the blinde or ignorant men haue faith, abſolutly diuine, whoſe motiue is Gods word read by a particular fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible man? If anie anſwer, that <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> to them is but à condition of their beleuing, but the whole moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, is Gods word, which is written: I replie, Firſt, that their beleif de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon this condition, and how can infallible faith depend
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:152999:235"/> vpon à condition, which is fallible? Secondly, that thus the word <hi>Read,</hi> and not, <hi>Written,</hi> muſt be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of their beleif: And ſo Scripture is not the formal cauſe of their faith: For Scripture is onely the <hi>word written.</hi> I ask therfore, what is the external formal cauſe of the blinde and ignorant mens beleif of that which is in Scripture? For ſome ſuch external cauſe there muſt be, as Whitaker l. 1. de Scrip. c. 6. p. 64. Potter and others grant; not the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin it ſelf: For that is the material obiect of their faith, and the thing, which is beleued. Nor the writing of it, or letters of the Scripture. For that they perceaue or vnderſtand not: Nor the <hi>Reading,</hi> For that is fallible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If anie ſay, that the doctrin is both the material and formal cauſe of their beleif, becaus it is credible for itſelf. I replie: Firſt, that this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilitie for itſelf, or internal light in the doctrin, is feigned and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretofore, in that we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:152999:236"/> c. 14. of the Scripture. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that aſſent to doctrin for itſelf, cannot be faith, becaus faith is an aſſent for authoritie of ſome that propoſeth doctrin. Thirdly, that thus Scripture or writing, is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of beleif (as Proteſtants ſaid before c. 11. ſec. 1.) but meerly doctrin is that cauſe, and that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is but a conſeruer, or pointer to diuine doctrin, but no cauſe at al of beleuing it. Let them then not ſay, that Scripture is the principal external formal cauſe of their bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, what they beleue; but confeſs, that Scripture, or writing of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne doctrin, ſerues them to no more, then <hi>Reading</hi> ſerues the blind or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who, as they haue the ſame faith, which the learned, ſo muſt they haue the ſame external formal cauſe of faith, which they haue: but that al the formal cauſe of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing what they finde in Scripture, is the internal light of the doctrin it ſelf, and that they haue no external formal cauſe of their beleif of it; and
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:152999:236"/> that writing or reading of it, doth but point to the veritie or light of the doctrin, as they ſay of the Churches teſtimonie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it doth but point at the word of God, which is to deſtroie al formal faith, which is an aſſent for authoritie, and to become En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts and to make al Chriſtian doctrin ridiculous to Infidels, in telling them, that Chriſtians haue no external formal cauſe, why they beleue, ether the Scripture to be written by Gods inſpiration, or that which is in it, to be Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, beſide the Scripture or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin itſelf. And that, as the Church doth but point to the diuinitie of the Scripture, but is no formal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of our beleuing it to be diuine: So the Scripture doth but point at the diuinitie of the doctrin which it conteineth, but is no formal cauſe of beleuing it to be diuine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Nether can they giue a good reaſon, why they should ſay, that Gods writing should be credible of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:152999:237"/> be credible of itſelf to be Gods wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and need onely the Churches pointing to it for to beleue, that it is Gods writing; and that Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin should not be credible of itſelf to be his doctrin, and need onely the Scriptures pointing to it, that it is his doctrin. For why should not Gods doctrin be as credible of itſelf, to be his writing? And ſo al external formal cauſing of beleif is gon, and onely pointing to the obiect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeif, is left. And Proteſtants muſt not ſay: that they beleue anie thing, becaus it is in Scripture, but onely pointeth to what they beleue, as they ſay, they beleue not Scripture to be the word of God, becaus the Church teſtifieth, that it is ſo, but for it ſelf, being pointed to by the Church.

               <head>NINTEENTH CHAPTER. That Scripture doth not clearly enough propoſe al points of faith.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat Scripture doth not clearly enough propoſe al points of faith, is euident: Firſt, becaus (as we haue already proued) it teacheth not al points of faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and much leſſ ſo clearly, as is neceſſarie to beget diuine faith of them al Secondly, becaus Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nowhere ſaieth, that it teacheth al points of faith ſo clearly And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Proteſtants can haue no diuine faith, that it teacheth al points ſo clearly, as is neceſſarie to faith. Thirdly, becaus the Scripture itſelf ſaieth, that in it are ſome hard and difficult things 2. Petri 3. And Acts 8. When S. Phillip had asked the Eunuch, whether he vnderſtood,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:152999:242"/> what he read in Scripture, He anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered; <hi>And how can I, vnles ſomes hew me?</hi> and the place which he read, was of the paſſion of Chriſt, which is a moſt neceſſarie point of faith. Whervpon Whitaker l. 2. de Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura p. 229. ſaieth; <hi>The Eunuch, without Philip, nether beleued, nor vnderſtood, what was ſufficient to ſaluation.</hi> And yet he was a pious man. And Luke. 24. <hi>Ieſus beginning from Moiſes, and al the Prophets, interpreted to them in al Scriptures, which were of him.</hi> And what needed he to interpret the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, which were of him, if they had been of themſelues clear enough to beget faith? And yet the knowledg of Chriſt, is a point moſt neceſſarie. Fourthly, holie Fathers frequently ſay, that the Scripture is obſcure, or hard to be vnderſtood, whoſe teſtimonies I omit for breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake: And to ſay, they meane not of anie point of faith, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſay, is mere voluntarie. Fiftly, if the Scripture were plain enough in al points of faith, there would
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:152999:243"/> need no gift of Interpretation for points faith. For to what end need Interpretation, where there is cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie enough to breed faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Finally, this is ſo euident, as Whitaker Contro. 1. q. 4. c. 1. ſaieth <hi>When he</hi> (Bellarmin) <hi>maketh this</hi>

                  <hi>the ſtate of the queſtion, whether Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of itſelf be ſo clear, as without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, it ſufficeth of itſelf to end and decide al Controuerſies of faith, he fighteth without an aduerſarie: For in this he hath not vs for Aduerſaries.</hi> And ibid. <hi>They ſay, but falſly, that we think that Scripture, without interpretation, ſufficeth to decide al Controuerſies.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould, Scripture of itſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interpretation, ſufficeth not to end al Controuerſies of faith. Caluin alſo 4. Inſtit. c. 7. §. 25. being vrged, that the words of the inſtitution of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, did plainly teach the real and ſubſtantial preſence of Chriſt, anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth; <hi>As if you could caſt the gift of Interpretation out of the Church, which giueth light to the word.</hi> So that the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:152999:243"/> Scripture doth not clearly enough teach, what the Euchariſt is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light Interpretation: And yet it is a great point of faith And the ſame is euident in the diſſentions of Proteſtans about ſo manie points of faith. For they being (forſooth) holie men, would not gainſay clear Scripture. At leaſt true learned and holie men could hardly fal into anie errors in faith, becaus al points therof were clearly ſet down in Scripture: And yet S. Hierom. l. 2. contra Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, and S. Auſtin l. 2. de Baptiſ. c. 1. 5. l. 3. c. 14. and De dono perſeueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae c. 21. ſay it is hard, euen for the beſt learned, not to fal into ſome ſuch errors. And we ſee it in S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and his Fellowes, and in others. 3. Proteſtants Confeſſions, that al points of faith are not clear enough in Scripture, may be ſeen ſupra c. 2. ſec. 2. and c. 4. ſec. 2.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THat the Scriptures propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of points of faith, is not neceſſarie in ordinarie courſe, to haue diuine faith, is euident Firſt; becaus the Scripture no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſaieth it. Secondly, becaus the Scripture is not the external formal cauſe of faith, as we haue shewed, that the authoritie of the Church is. Thirdly, becaus diuine faith was for more then <note n="a" place="margin">Caluin 1. Inſtit. c. 6. §. 2. See ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra c. 17. 18.</note> 2000. yeares, befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re there was anie Scripture. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becaus euen after Scripture was, there was in S. <note n="b" place="margin">L. 3. c. 7.</note> Irenes time, faith among ſome barbarous nations, where was no Scripture. And this is ſo euident, that although Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:152999:244"/> muſt needs ſay the contrarie, becaus commonly they teach, (as we ſaw c. 11. ſec. 1.) that Scripture is the vtmoſt formal cauſe of their faith (without which cauſe, vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there can be no formal faith) yet ſometimes they confeſſ it. Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Contro. 1. q 6. c. 7. <hi>Hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, Therfore ſcriptures are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſarie: Rightly:</hi> And it is clear out of which Proteſtants grant that there was diuine faith in the world for 2000. yeares before anie Scripture was: and ſince Chriſt alſo, where there was no Scripture: which conuinceth, that Scripture nether of its nature, nor of Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an abſolutly neceſſarie means (in ordinarie courſe) to haue faith. For then the Barbarians, of whome <note place="margin">L. 3. c. 4.</note> S. Ireney ſpeaketh, could not haue had diuine faith. And Chillingworth c. 2. n. 159. ſaieth: <hi>ſcripture is not ſo much of the being of Chriſtian doctrin, as requiſit to the wel being of it.</hi> And <note place="margin">Vvhy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not the ſufficient Propoſer.</note> out of al which we haue hitherto ſaied of Scripture, it is euident, that
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:152999:245"/> it is not the <hi>Al—ſufficient Propoſer,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God for to beleue with diuine faith. For firſt, it is no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual perſon, as doubtles a proper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Propoſer of points of faith, is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it propoſeth not al points, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which God wil haue vs to beleue with diuine faith. Thirdly, it doth not propoſe clearly enough al the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> points of faith, which it propoſeth. Fourthly, it propoſeth not points <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of faith to al kindes of men, who are capable of external propoſal. Fiftly, it hath not been in al times, nor in al places, when and where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> diuine faith was. Sixtly, in ordinarie courſe, it is not neceſſarie, to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> diuine faith. Al which agree to the proper Propoſer of points of faith inſtituted by God. But now hauing ſeen, what the Scripture is not, let vs ſee, what it is. For though it be not the proper Propoſer of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God, yet it hath manie excellent properties conducing to that end.</p>

For they denying the Infallibilitie of the Church, Councels, or Fathers, and reiecting al teſtimonie of miracles, leaue the true Chriſtian Church no proper armes to fight againſt them, but the Scripture, which God hath made to be of ſo great eſteem among Chriſtians, as S.

Catholiks anſwer: Firſt, that S. Paul ſpeaketh onely of the old Teſtament, is as euident, becaus, much of the New<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, was not then written, as alſo, becaus he ſaieth, that Timothy had <hi>known it from his Childhood,</hi> and he had not known the New Teſtament from
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:152999:253"/> his Childhood. And if Proteſtants wil ſay, the Old teſtament ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teacheth al points of faith, they make the New Teſtament needles, which none of them dare ſay, at leaſt it were not neceſſarie. For how can the New teſtament be neceſſarie, if the old be ſufficient? And I think, they wil not ſay, the New Teſtament is not neceſſarie: And that S. Paul ſpeaketh of the New teſtament, Proteſtants nether proue nor can proue: wheras we proue plainly, that he ſpeaketh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the old Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their ſecond anſwer is, that the Apoſtle ſaieth not, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>is ſufficient,</hi> but onely ſaieth <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:</hi> And a thing may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is not ſufficient: Their third is, that the Apoſtle ſaieth not, that the Scripture is profitable to teach al things, to correct al things, to reproue al things, to inſtruct in al things, but ſimply to teach, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, to reproue, to inſtruct ſo that: by <hi>to euerie good work,</hi> he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:152999:253"/> not <hi>euerie particular good work,</hi> but <hi>al kinds of good works,</hi> as are teaching, correcting, reprouing, inſtructing. And ſo three waies they anſwer ſufficiently to this argument to which Whitaker Contro. 1. q. 6. c. 14. ſaieth: <hi>no Papiſt euer anſwered ſuffictently, or can anſwer.</hi>
               </p>

Ihon, who after this wrote his Apocalyps, in which there are ſome things, which S. Paul neuer told to the Galathians. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becaus the Fathers, Ambroſe, Hierom, Chryſoſtom, Theophilact, Oecumenius, Auſtin, ſo plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:152999:254"/> it, as Whitaker loco cir. ſaieth: <hi>we need not anſwer them.</hi> And S. Chryſoſtom eypoundeth it of ſuch an addition to the Scripture, which <hi>ouerturneth ether al, or anie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the Goſpel.</hi> And S. Auſtin tract. 98. in Ioan proueth it, becaus other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe S. Paul had accurſed himſelf, who deſired to come again to the Theſſalonians, that he <hi>might haue adde what was wanting to their faith.</hi> Fourthly, becaus the Apoſtle there, ſpeaketh of a thing which was not onely beſide, but alſo contrarie to what he had preached, to wit the keeping of the law of Moiſes, which he called <hi>an other Goſpel.</hi> And of it and ſuch like, he ſaid iuſtly, that he deſerued to be accurſed, who should teach beſide what he had preached to the Galathians, to whome, being but rude, it is not like, he had, as then, preached al points of faith whatſoeuer. I may ad alſo, that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not beſide the Scripture, becaus the Scripture teacheth them mediatly, in ſending vs to the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:152999:254"/> Church, whome it teſtifieth to teach al truth. In which ſenſe, it may be S. Auſtin l. 3. contra Petilian c. 6. ſaied, that he were Anathema, <hi>who shold teach anie thing which belongeth to our faith and life, beſide that which we haue receaued in the legal and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſcripture,</hi> becaus al that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to our faith or life, is mediatly in Scripture, though perhaps by <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> he mean <hi>contrarie,</hi> as he doth tract. 98. cit, and l. 17. contra Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum c. 3. and l. 23. c. 7. For in the aforeſaid place he ſpeaketh of flying ſchiſme <hi>contravnitatem Chriſti,</hi> which is not only beſide, but indeed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietoholie Scripture. And Whitaker Contro. 1. q. 6. c. 14. euen vrging this place of the Apoſtle, ſaieth: <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agreable to ſcripture are to be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and who receaue them not, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.—Theſe Fathers ſpeake of Traditions agreable to ſcriptures.</hi> So that Traditions agreable to Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, are not condemned here by the Apoſtle: and approued by Fathers,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:152999:255"/> and admitted by Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for what they alleadge out of ſome Fathers, that Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth al things neceſſarie, proueth no more, then what we haue ſaid before, that it conteineth the ſumme of Chriſtian faith, al things that are neceſſarie to be explicitly bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of euerie one, and the greateſt parte of the reſt, and mediatly al points of faith whatſoeuer: but not that it conteineth immediatly al points whatſouer. For S. Hilaire l. 2. de Trinit. ſpeaking of the forme of Baptiſme, ſaieth: <hi>what is it, that is not conteined in that ſacrament of mans ſaluation?</hi> Hierom. praefat. in libros Paralipomenon. <hi>Al learning of ſcripture, is conteined in this book.</hi> S. Auſtin ſerm. 194. &amp; ſerm. 130. <hi>The Creed conteineth al the myſteries of our faith.</hi> Nor the Fathers only ſpeak thus, but euen both Catholiks and Proteſtants alſo: For Catechiſmus ad Parachos in Praefat. §. 12. ſaith: <hi>the Apoſtles Creed conteineth al things;
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:152999:255"/> that are to be beleued: and our Lords praier, al that is asked.</hi> The like ſaieth the Caluiniſt French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, Luther in c. 15. Geneſis that Melchiſedechs ſpeech to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>conteineth al that can be ſaid of Religion.</hi> Caluin 3. Inſtit. c. 20. §. 48. The Lords praier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth al, that we are to ask of God: And in Math. 16. v. 18. That Peters Confeſſion <hi>conteineth the whole ſumm of our ſaluation.</hi> Which kinde of ſpeeches no man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth of euerie particular thing, that we are to beleue or ask of God. Beſids, manie Proteſtants doe grant, that Scripture doth not contein euerie particular point of faith, no not their moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of al, which is, that itſelf is the word of God. And Laude cited l. 2. c. 5. ſec. 2. ſaieth, that <hi>when the Fathers ſay; we are to relie vpon Scripture onely, they are neuer to be vnderſtood with excluſion of Tradition, in whatſoeuer it may
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:152999:256"/> be had, and that without the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches help, we may miſtake the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And Feild ibid. <hi>That they doe not make the Scripture, the rule of their faith, but that other things in their kinde are Rules likewiſe, in ſuch ſorte, as it is not ſafe without reſpect had vnto them, to iudge of things by the Scripture alone.</hi> And alſo White cited l. 1. c. 10. <hi>That the Doctrin of the Church is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule, and the Rule of faith</hi> And Baro ibid. <hi>That Tradition is an infallible Rule.</hi> And Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth ibid. <hi>That vniuerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is as infallible as the Scripture.</hi> And out of this, is alſo anſwered, that the Fathers cal Scripture <hi>The Rule,</hi> or, <hi>A Rule of faith.</hi> For they cal alſo the Apoſtles Cred ſo: As Tertullian l. Praeſcrip. c. 13. S. Auſtin ſerm. de Symbolo, S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney l. 1. c. 1. S. Epiphanius haereſ. 31. and others; And Proteſtants, as Kemnice in locis p. 10. Perkins in his reformed Catholik at the end,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:152999:256"/> and vpon the Creed, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and Pleſſie de Eccleſ. c. 8. ſaieth; <hi>The Fathers cal it ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the Rule of faith,</hi> Potter ſec. 7. p. 78. 89. And yet mean not, that it conteineth immediatly al points of faith whatſoeuer. Nay a Rule is not to contein al faith, but to regulate al.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence alſo may be anſwered, what Proteſtants obiect, that if the Scripture contein not al points of faith whatſoeuer, it should be imperfect. For imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is that onely, which hath not al, that it ought to haue. And Scripture hath al the points of faith, which it ought to haue, and therfore is perfect. As the Creed conteineth al that it ought to haue, and therfore is a perfect Rule, though it contein not abſolutly al points of faith whatſoeuer. And yet Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth cited aboue c. 5. granteth, that Scripture <hi>is not abſolutly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:152999:257"/> Rule.</hi> But ſeeing Scripture, and the Creed, haue al, for which they were made, both are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted perfect Rules; and not to be accounted imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they haue not ſomething for which they were not made. It ſufficeth, that they can ſufficiently rule al that, for ruling of which, they were made. And Proteſtants ſuppoſe (but neuer can proue) that ether the Creed was made, or the Scripture written, to rule immediatly al points of faith what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Nay ſome of them confeſſ the contrarie, as we shewed befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re c. 5. ſec. 2. who muſt as wel anſwer, what is brought to proue the Scripture to contein imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly al points of faith whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or to be the immediat Rule of al points of faith, as we.</p>
